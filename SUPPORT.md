    Status, Exynos 4210 UART (ARM): Supported
    Status, OMAP UART (ARM): Supported
    Status, SCI(F) UART: Supported

### Hypervisor 'debug keys'

    Status: Supported, not security supported

These are functions triggered either from the host serial console,
or via the xl 'debug-keys' command,
which cause Xen to dump various hypervisor state to the console.

### Hypervisor synchronous console output (sync_console)

    Status: Supported, not security supported

Xen command-line flag to force synchronous console output.
Useful for debugging, but not suitable for production environments
due to incurred overhead.

### gdbsx

    Status, x86: Supported, not security supported

Debugger to debug ELF guests

### Soft-reset for PV guests

    Status: Supported

Soft-reset allows a new kernel to start 'from scratch' with a fresh VM state,
but with all the memory from the previous state of the VM intact.
This is primarily designed to allow "crash kernels",
which can do core dumps of memory to help with debugging in the event of a crash.

### xentrace

    Status, x86: Supported

Tool to capture Xen trace buffer data

### gcov

    Status: Supported, Not security supported

Export hypervisor coverage data suitable for analysis by gcov or lcov.

## Memory Management

### Dynamic memory control

    Status: Supported

Allows a guest to add or remove memory after boot-time.
This is typically done by a guest kernel agent known as a "balloon driver".

### Populate-on-demand memory

    Status, x86 HVM: Supported

This is a mechanism that allows normal operating systems with only a balloon driver
to boot with memory < maxmem.

### Memory Sharing

    Status, x86 HVM: Expermental

Allow sharing of identical pages between guests

### Memory Paging

    Status, x86 HVM: Experimenal

Allow pages belonging to guests to be paged to disk

### Transcendent Memory

    Status: Experimental

Transcendent Memory (tmem) allows the creation of hypervisor memory pools
which guests can use to store memory
rather than caching in its own memory or swapping to disk.
Having these in the hypervisor
can allow more efficient aggregate use of memory across VMs.

### Alternative p2m

    Status, x86 HVM: Tech Preview
    Status, ARM: Tech Preview

Allows external monitoring of hypervisor memory
by maintaining multiple physical to machine (p2m) memory mappings.

## Resource Management

### CPU Pools

    Status: Supported

Groups physical cpus into distinct groups called "cpupools",
with each pool having the capability
of using different schedulers and scheduling properties.

### Credit Scheduler

    Status: Supported

A weighted proportional fair share virtual CPU scheduler.
This is the default scheduler.

### Credit2 Scheduler

    Status: Supported

A general purpose scheduler for Xen,
designed with particular focus on fairness, responsiveness, and scalability

### RTDS based Scheduler

    Status: Experimental

A soft real-time CPU scheduler
built to provide guaranteed CPU capacity to guest VMs on SMP hosts

### ARINC653 Scheduler

    Status: Supported

A periodically repeating fixed timeslice scheduler.
Currently only single-vcpu domains are supported.

### Null Scheduler

    Status: Experimental

A very simple, very static scheduling policy
that always schedules the same vCPU(s) on the same pCPU(s).
It is designed for maximum determinism and minimum overhead
on embedded platforms.

### NUMA scheduler affinity

    Status, x86: Supported

Enables NUMA aware scheduling in Xen

## Scalability

### Super page support

    Status, x86 HVM/PVH, HAP: Supported
    Status, x86 HVM/PVH, Shadow, 2MiB: Supported
    Status, ARM: Supported

NB that this refers to the ability of guests
to have higher-level page table entries point directly to memory,
improving TLB performance.
On ARM, and on x86 in HAP mode,
the guest has whatever support is enabled by the hardware.
On x86 in shadow mode, only 2MiB (L2) superpages are available;
furthermore, they do not have the performance characteristics
of hardware superpages.

Also note is feature independent
of the ARM "page granularity" feature (see below).

### x86/PVHVM

    Status: Supported

This is a useful label for a set of hypervisor features
which add paravirtualized functionality to HVM guests
for improved performance and scalability.
This includes exposing event channels to HVM guests.

with access to physical devices to act as back-ends.

See the appropriate "Device Passthrough" section
for more information about security support.

### Device Model Stub Domains

Compile time disabled for ARM by default.

### Virtual Machine Introspection

    Status, x86: Supported, not security supported

### XSM & FLASK

    Status: Experimental

Compile time disabled by default.

Also note that using XSM
to delegate various domain control hypercalls
to particular other domains, rather than only permitting use by dom0,
is also specifically excluded from security support for many hypercalls.
Please see XSA-77 for more details.

### FLASK default policy

    Status: Experimental

The default policy includes FLASK labels and roles for a "typical" Xen-based system
with dom0, driver domains, stub domains, domUs, and so on.

## Virtual Hardware, Hypervisor

### x86/Nested PV

    Status, x86 Xen HVM: Tech Preview

This means running a Xen hypervisor inside an HVM domain on a Xen system,
with support for PV L2 guests only
(i.e., hardware virtualization extensions not provided
to the guest).

This works, but has performance limitations
because the L1 dom0 can only access emulated L1 devices.

Xen may also run inside other hypervisors (KVM, Hyper-V, VMWare),
but nobody has reported on performance.

### x86/Nested HVM

    Status, x86 HVM: Experimental

This means providing hardware virtulization support to guest VMs
allowing, for instance, a nested Xen to support both PV and HVM guests.
It also implies support for other hypervisors,
such as KVM, Hyper-V, Bromium, and so on as guests.

### vPMU

    Status, x86: Supported, Not security supported

Virtual Performance Management Unit for HVM guests

Disabled by default (enable with hypervisor command line option).
This feature is not security supported: see http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-163.html

### x86/PCI Device Passthrough

    Status, x86 PV: Supported, with caveats
    Status, x86 HVM: Supported, with caveats

Only systems using IOMMUs are supported.

Not compatible with migration, populate-on-demand, altp2m,
introspection, memory sharing, or memory paging.

Because of hardware limitations
(affecting any operating system or hypervisor),
it is generally not safe to use this feature
to expose a physical device to completely untrusted guests.
However, this feature can still confer significant security benefit
when used to remove drivers and backends from domain 0
(i.e., Driver Domains).

### ARM/Non-PCI device passthrough

    Status: Supported, not security supported

Note that this still requires an IOMMU
that covers the DMA of the device to be passed through.

### ARM: 16K and 64K page granularity in guests

    Status: Supported, with caveats

No support for QEMU backends in a 16K or 64K domain.

### ARM: Guest Device Tree support

    Status: Supported

### ARM: Guest ACPI support

    Status: Supported

## Virtual Hardware, QEMU

These are devices available in HVM mode using a qemu devicemodel (the default).
Note that other devices are available but not security supported.

### x86/Emulated platform devices (QEMU):

    Status, piix3: Supported

### x86/Emulated network (QEMU):

    Status, e1000: Supported
    Status, rtl8193: Supported
    Status, virtio-net: Supported

### x86/Emulated storage (QEMU):

    Status, piix3 ide: Supported
    Status, ahci: Supported

### x86/Emulated graphics (QEMU):

    Status, cirrus-vga: Supported
    Status, stgvga: Supported

### x86/Emulated audio (QEMU):

    Status, sb16: Supported
    Status, es1370: Supported
    Status, ac97: Supported

### x86/Emulated input (QEMU):

    Status, usbmouse: Supported
    Status, usbtablet: Supported
    Status, ps/2 keyboard: Supported
    Status, ps/2 mouse: Supported

### x86/Emulated serial card (QEMU):

    Status, UART 16550A: Supported

### x86/Host USB passthrough (QEMU):

    Status: Supported, not security supported

## Virtual Firmware

### x86/HVM iPXE

    Status: Supported, with caveats

Booting a guest via PXE.
PXE inherently places full trust of the guest in the network,
and so should only be used
when the guest network is under the same administrative control
as the guest itself.

### x86/HVM BIOS

    Status, SeaBIOS (qemu-xen): Supported
    Status, ROMBIOS (qemu-xen-traditional): Supported

Booting a guest via guest BIOS firmware

### x86/HVM OVMF

    Status, qemu-xen: Supported

OVMF firmware implements the UEFI boot protocol.

## Keys found in the Feature Support subsections

### Status

This gives the overall status of the feature,
including security support status, functional completeness, etc.
Refer to the detailed definitions below.

If support differs based on implementation
(for instance, x86 / ARM, Linux / QEMU / FreeBSD),
one line for each set of implementations will be listed.

## Definition of Status labels

Each Status value corresponds to levels of security support,
testing, stability, etc., as follows:

### Experimental

    Functional completeness: No
    Functional stability: Here be dragons
    Interface stability: Not stable
    Security supported: No

### Tech Preview

    Functional completeness: Yes
    Functional stability: Quirky
    Interface stability: Provisionally stable
    Security supported: No

#### Supported

    Functional completeness: Yes
    Functional stability: Normal
    Interface stability: Yes
    Security supported: Yes

#### Deprecated

    Functional completeness: Yes
    Functional stability: Quirky
    Interface stability: No (as in, may disappear the next release)
    Security supported: Yes

All of these may appear in modified form.
There are several interfaces, for instance,
which are officially declared as not stable;
in such a case this feature may be described as "Stable / Interface not stable".

## Definition of the status label interpretation tags

### Functionally complete

Does it behave like a fully functional feature?
Does it work on all expected platforms,
or does it only work for a very specific sub-case?
Does it have a sensible UI,
or do you have to have a deep understanding of the internals
to get it to work properly?

### Functional stability

What is the risk of it exhibiting bugs?

General answers to the above:

 * **Here be dragons**

   Pretty likely to still crash / fail to work.
   Not recommended unless you like life on the bleeding edge.

 * **Quirky**

   Mostly works but may have odd behavior here and there.
   Recommended for playing around or for non-production use cases.

 * **Normal**

   Ready for production use

### Interface stability

If I build a system based on the current interfaces,
will they still work when I upgrade to the next version?

 * **Not stable**

   Interface is still in the early stages and
   still fairly likely to be broken in future updates.

 * **Provisionally stable**

   We're not yet promising backwards compatibility,
   but we think this is probably the final form of the interface.
   It may still require some tweaks.

 * **Stable**

   We will try very hard to avoid breaking backwards  compatibility,
   and to fix any regressions that are reported.

### Security supported

Will XSAs be issued if security-related bugs are discovered
in the functionality?

If "no",
anyone who finds a security-related bug in the feature
will be advised to
post it publicly to the Xen Project mailing lists
(or contact another security response team,
if a relevant one exists).

Bugs found after the end of **Security-Support-Until**
in the Release Support section will receive an XSA
if they also affect newer, security-supported, versions of Xen.
However, the Xen Project will not provide official fixes
for non-security-supported versions.

Three common 'diversions' from the 'Supported' category
are given the following labels:

  * **Supported, Not security supported**

    Functionally complete, normal stability,
    interface stable, but no security support

  * **Supported, Security support external**

    This feature is security supported
    by a different organization (not the XenProject).
    See **External security support** below.

  * **Supported, with caveats**

    This feature is security supported only under certain conditions,
    or support is given only for certain aspects of the feature,
    or the feature should be used with care
    because it is easy to use insecurely without knowing it.
    Additional details will be given in the description.

### Interaction with other features

Not all features interact well with all other features.
Some features are only for HVM guests; some don't work with migration, &c.

### External security support

The XenProject security team
provides security support for XenProject projects.

We also provide security support for Xen-related code in Linux,
which is an external project but doesn't have its own security process.

External projects that provide their own security support for Xen-related features are listed below.

  * QEMU https://wiki.qemu.org/index.php/SecurityProcess

  * Libvirt https://libvirt.org/securityprocess.html

  * FreeBSD https://www.freebsd.org/security/

  * NetBSD http://www.netbsd.org/support/security/

  * OpenBSD https://www.openbsd.org/security.html
