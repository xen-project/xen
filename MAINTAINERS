	List of maintainers and how to submit changes
	=============================================

Please try to follow the guidelines below.  This will make things
easier on the maintainers.  Not all of these guidelines matter for every
trivial patch so apply some common sense.

1.	Always _test_ your changes, however small, on at least 4 or
	5 people, preferably many more.

2.	Make sure your changes compile correctly in multiple
	configurations. For example, both 32- and 64-bit x86.

3.	Make a patch available to the relevant maintainer in the list. Use
	'diff -u' to make the patch easy to merge. Be prepared to get your
	changes sent back with seemingly silly requests about formatting
	and variable names.  These aren't as silly as they seem. One
	job the maintainers do is to keep things looking the same.

	PLEASE see https://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Submitting_Xen_Patches for
	hints on how to submit a patch to xen-unstable in a suitable
	form.

	PLEASE try to include any credit lines you want added with the
	patch. It avoids people being missed off by mistake and makes
	it easier to know who wants adding and who doesn't.

	PLEASE document known bugs. If it doesn't work for everything
	or does something very odd once a month document it.

	PLEASE remember that submissions must be made under the terms
	of the "Developer's Certificate of Origin" (DCO) and should include
	a Signed-off-by: line.

4.	Make sure you have the right to send any changes you make. If you
	do changes at work you may find your employer owns the patch
	not you.

5.	Happy hacking.


	Stable Release Maintenance
	==========================

The policy for inclusion in a Xen stable release is different to that
for inclusion in xen-unstable.

Please see https://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Xen_Maintenance_Releases for more
information.

Backport requests should be made on the xen-devel@lists.xenproject.org
list. Remember to copy the appropriate stable branch maintainer who
will be listed in this section of the MAINTAINERS file in the
appropriate branch.

	Unstable Subsystem Maintainers
	==============================

Descriptions of section entries:

	M: Maintainer: FullName <address@domain>
	   Maintainers should be CCed on patches.  At least one of them
	   needs to approve changes to the covered files.
	R: Designated reviewer: FullName <address@domain>
	   Reviewers should be CCed on patches.  However, they do not
	   have a formal governance role, and are listed here
	   simply because of their own request.
	L: Mailing list that is relevant to this area
	W: Web-page with status/info
	T: SCM tree type and location.  Type is one of: git, hg, quilt, stgit.
	S: Status, one of the following:
	   Supported:	Someone is actually paid to look after this.
	   Maintained:	Someone actually looks after it.
	   Odd Fixes:	It has a maintainer but they don't have time to do
			much other than throw the odd patch in. See below..
	   Orphan:	No current maintainer [but maybe you could take the
			role as you write your new code].
	   Obsolete:	Old code. Something tagged obsolete generally means
			it has been replaced by a better system and you
			should be using that.
	F: Files and directories with wildcard patterns.
	   A trailing slash includes all files and subdirectory files.
	   F:	drivers/net/	all files in and below drivers/net
	   F:	drivers/net/*	all files in drivers/net, but not below
	   F:	*/net/*		all files in "any top level directory"/net
	   One pattern per line.  Multiple F: lines acceptable.
	X: Files and directories that are NOT maintained, same rules as F:
	   Files exclusions are tested before file matches.
	   Can be useful for excluding a specific subdirectory, for instance:
	   F:	net/
	   X:	net/ipv6/
	   matches all files in and below net excluding net/ipv6/
	K: Keyword perl extended regex pattern to match content in a
	   patch or file.  For instance:
	   K: of_get_profile
	      matches patches or files that contain "of_get_profile"
	   K: \b(printk|pr_(info|err))\b
	      matches patches or files that contain one or more of the words
	      printk, pr_info or pr_err
	   One regex pattern per line.  Multiple K: lines acceptable.
	V: Version identifier that must be under THE REST and follows
	   the format:
	   xen-maintainers-<version format number of this file>


	Check-in policy
	===============

In order for a patch to be checked in, in general, several conditions
must be met:

1. In order to get a change to a given file committed, it must have
   the approval of at least one maintainer of that file.

   A patch of course needs Acks from the maintainers of each file that
   it changes; so a patch which changes xen/arch/x86/traps.c,
   xen/arch/x86/mm/p2m.c, and xen/arch/x86/mm/shadow/multi.c would
   require an Ack from each of the three sets of maintainers.

   See below for rules on nested maintainership.

2. Each change must have appropriate approval from someone other than
   the person who wrote it.  This can be either:

  a. An Acked-by from a maintainer of the code being touched (a
     co-maintainer if available, or a more general level maintainer if
     not available; see the secton on nested maintainership)

  b. A Reviewed-by by anyone of suitable stature in the community

3. Sufficient time must have been given for anyone to respond.  This
   depends in large part upon the urgency and nature of the patch.
   For a straightforward uncontroversial patch, a day or two may be
   sufficient; for a controversial patch, a week or two may be better.

4. There must be no "open" objections.

In a case where one person submits a patch and a maintainer gives an
Ack, the Ack stands in for both the approval requirement (#1) and the
Acked-by-non-submitter requirement (#2).

In a case where a maintainer themselves submits a patch, the
Signed-off-by meets the approval requirement (#1); so a Review
from anyone in the community suffices for requirement #2.

Before a maintainer checks in their own patch with another community
member's R-b but no co-maintainer Ack, it is especially important to
give their co-maintainer opportunity to give feedback, perhaps
declaring their intention to check it in without their co-maintainers
ack a day before doing so.

In the case where two people collaborate on a patch, at least one of
whom is a maintainer -- typically where one maintainer will do an
early version of the patch, and another maintainer will pick it up and
revise it -- there should be two Signed-off-by's and one Acked-by or
Reviewed-by; with the maintainer who did the most recent change
sending the patch, and an Acked-by or Reviewed-by coming from the
maintainer who did not most recently edit the patch.  This satisfies
the requirement #2 because a) the Signed-off-by of the sender approves
the final version of the patch; including all parts of the patch that
the sender did not write b) the Reviewed-by approves the final version
of the patch, including all patches that the reviewer did not write.
Thus all code in the patch has been approved by someone who did not
write it.

Maintainers may choose to override non-maintainer objections in the
case that consensus can't be reached.

As always, no policy can cover all possible situations.  In
exceptional circumstances, committers may commit a patch in absence of
one or more of the above requirements, if they are reasonably
confident that the other maintainers will approve of their decision in
retrospect.

       The meaning of nesting
       ======================

Many maintainership areas are "nested": for example, there are entries
for xen/arch/x86 as well as xen/arch/x86/mm, and even
xen/arch/x86/mm/shadow; and there is a section at the end called "THE
REST" which lists all committers.  The meaning of nesting is that:

1. Under normal circumstances, the Ack of the most specific maintainer
is both necessary and sufficient to get a change to a given file
committed.  So a change to xen/arch/x86/mm/shadow/multi.c requires the
the Ack of the xen/arch/x86/mm/shadow maintainer for that part of the
patch, but would not require the Ack of the xen/arch/x86 maintainer or
the xen/arch/x86/mm maintainer.

2. In unusual circumstances, a more general maintainer's Ack can stand
in for or even overrule a specific maintainer's Ack.  Unusual
circumstances might include:
 - The patch is fixing a high-priority issue causing immediate pain,
 and the more specific maintainer is not available.
 - The more specific maintainer has not responded either to the
 original patch, nor to "pings", within a reasonable amount of time.
 - The more general maintainer wants to overrule the more specific
 maintainer on some issue. (This should be exceptional.)
 - In the case of a disagreement between maintainers, THE REST can
 settle the matter by majority vote.  (This should be very exceptional
 indeed.)
