                     XSM/FLASK Configuration
                     -----------------------

Xen provides a security framework called XSM, and FLASK is an implementation of
a security model using this framework (at the time of writing, it is the only
one). FLASK defines a mandatory access control policy providing fine-grained
controls over Xen domains, allowing the policy writer to define what
interactions between domains, devices, and the hypervisor are permitted.

Some examples of what FLASK can do:
 - Prevent two domains from communicating via event channels or grants
 - Control which domains can use device passthrough (and which devices)
 - Restrict or audit operations performed by privileged domains
 - Prevent a privileged domain from arbitrarily mapping pages from other domains

Some of these examples require dom0 disaggregation to be useful, since the
domain build process requires the ability to write to the new domain's memory.


Setting up FLASK
----------------

Xen must be compiled with XSM and FLASK enabled; by default, the security
framework is disabled. Edit Config.mk or the .config file to set XSM_ENABLE and
FLASK_ENABLE to "y"; this change requires a make clean and rebuild.

FLASK uses only one domain configuration parameter (seclabel) defining the
full security label of the newly created domain. If using the example policy,
"seclabel='system_u:system_r:domU_t'" is an example of a normal domain. The
labels are in the same format as SELinux labels; see http://selinuxproject.org
for more details on the use of the user, role, and optional MLS/MCS labels.

FLASK policy overview
---------------------

Most of FLASK policy consists of defining the interactions allowed between
different types (domU_t would be the type in this example). For simple policies,
only type enforcement is used and the user and role are set to system_u and
system_r for all domains.

The FLASK security framework is mostly configured using a security policy file.
This policy file is not normally generated during the Xen build process because
it relies on the SELinux compiler "checkpolicy"; run

	make -C tools/flask/policy

to compile the example policy included with Xen. The policy is generated from
definition files under this directory. When creating or modifying security
policy, most modifications will be made to the xen type enforcement (.te) file
tools/flask/policy/policy/modules/xen/xen.te or the macro definitions in xen.if.
The XSM policy file needs to be copied to /boot and loaded as a module by grub.
The exact position of the module does not matter as long as it is after the Xen
kernel; it is normally placed either just above the dom0 kernel or at the end.
Once dom0 is running, the policy can be reloaded using "xl loadpolicy".

The example policy included with Xen demonstrates most of the features of FLASK
that can be used without dom0 disaggregation. The main types for domUs are:

 - domU_t is a domain that can communicate with any other domU_t
 - isolated_domU_t can only communicate with dom0
 - prot_domU_t is a domain type whose creation can be disabled with a boolean

HVM domains with stubdomain device models use two types (one per domain):
 - domHVM_t is an HVM domain that uses a stubdomain device model
 - dm_dom_t is the device model for a domain with type domHVM_t

One disadvantage of using type enforcement to enforce isolation is that a new
type is needed for each group of domains. In addition, it is not possible to
allow isolated_domU_t cannot to create loopback event channels without allowing
two domains of type isolated_domU_t to communicate with one another.

Users and roles
---------------

Users are defined in tools/flask/policy/policy/users. The example policy defines
two users (customer_1 and customer_2) in addition to the system user system_u.
Users are visible in the labels of domains and associated objects (event
channels); in the example policy, "customer_1:vm_r:domU_t" is a valid label for
the customer_1 user.

Access control rules involving users and roles are defined in the policy
constraints file (tools/flask/policy/policy/constraints). The example policy
provides constraints that prevent different users from communicating using
grants or event channels, while still allowing communication with dom0.

Resource Policy
---------------

The example policy also includes a resource type (nic_dev_t) for device
passthrough, configured to allow use by domU_t. To label the PCI device 3:2.0
for passthrough, run:

	tools/flask/utils/flask-label-pci 0000:03:02.0 system_u:object_r:nic_dev_t

This command must be rerun on each boot or after any policy reload.

The example policy was only tested with simple domain creation and may be
missing rules allowing accesses by dom0 or domU when a number of hypervisor
features are used. When first loading or writing a policy, you should run FLASK
in permissive mode (the default) and check the Xen logs (xl dmesg) for AVC
denials before using it in enforcing mode (flask_enforcing=1 on the command
line, or xl setenforce).


MLS/MCS policy
--------------

If you want to use the MLS policy, then set TYPE=xen-mls in the policy Makefile
before building the policy.  Note that the MLS constraints in policy/mls
are incomplete and are only a sample.


AVC denials
-----------

XSM:Flask will emit avc: denied messages when a permission is denied by the
policy, just like SELinux. For example, if the HVM rules are removed from the
declare_domain and create_domain interfaces:

# xl dmesg | grep avc
(XEN) avc:  denied  { setparam } for domid=0 scontext=system_u:system_r:dom0_t tcontext=system_u:system_r:domU_t tclass=hvm
(XEN) avc:  denied  { getparam } for domid=0 scontext=system_u:system_r:dom0_t tcontext=system_u:system_r:domU_t tclass=hvm
(XEN) avc:  denied  { irqlevel } for domid=0 scontext=system_u:system_r:dom0_t tcontext=system_u:system_r:domU_t tclass=hvm
(XEN) avc:  denied  { pciroute } for domid=0 scontext=system_u:system_r:dom0_t tcontext=system_u:system_r:domU_t tclass=hvm
(XEN) avc:  denied  { setparam } for domid=4 scontext=system_u:system_r:domU_t tcontext=system_u:system_r:domU_t tclass=hvm
(XEN) avc:  denied  { cacheattr } for domid=0 scontext=system_u:system_r:dom0_t tcontext=system_u:system_r:domU_t tclass=hvm
(XEN) avc:  denied  { pcilevel } for domid=0 scontext=system_u:system_r:dom0_t tcontext=system_u:system_r:domU_t tclass=hvm

Existing SELinux tools such as audit2allow can be applied to these denials, e.g.
xl dmesg | audit2allow

The generated allow rules can then be fed back into the policy by
adding them to xen.te, although manual review is advised and will
often lead to adding parameterized rules to the interfaces in xen.if
to address the general case.


Device Labeling in Policy
-------------------------

FLASK is capable of labeling devices and enforcing policies associated with
them. There are two methods to label devices: dynamic labeling using
flask-label-pci or similar tools run in dom0, or static labeling defined in
policy. Static labeling will make security policy machine-specific and may
prevent the system from booting after any hardware changes (adding PCI cards,
memory, or even changing certain BIOS settings). Dynamic labeling requires that
the domain performing the labeling be trusted to label all the devices in the
system properly.

To enable static device labeling, a checkpolicy >= 2.0.20 and libsepol >=2.0.39
are required. The policy Makefile (tools/flask/policy/Makefile) must also be
changed as follows:

########################################
#
# Build a binary policy locally
#
$(POLVER): policy.conf
        @echo "Compiling $(NAME) $(POLVER)"
       $(QUIET) $(CHECKPOLICY) $^ -o $@            (Comment out this line)
# Uncomment line below to enable policies for devices
#        $(QUIET) $(CHECKPOLICY) -t Xen $^ -o $@   (Uncomment this line)

########################################
#
# Install a binary policy
#
$(LOADPATH): policy.conf
        @echo "Compiling and installing $(NAME) $(LOADPATH)"
       $(QUIET) $(CHECKPOLICY) $^ -o $@            (Comment out this line)
# Uncomment line below to enable policies for devices
#        $(QUIET) $(CHECKPOLICY) -t Xen $^ -o $@   (Uncomment this line)


IRQs, PCI devices, I/O memory and ports can all be labeled.  There are
commented out lines in xen.te policy for examples on how to label devices.

Device Labeling
---------------

The "lspci -vvn" command can be used to output all the devices and identifiers
associated with them.  For example, to label an Intel e1000e ethernet card the
lspci output is..

00:19.0 0200: 8086:10de (rev 02)
        Subsystem: 1028:0276
        Interrupt: pin A routed to IRQ 33
        Region 0: Memory at febe0000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=128K]
        Region 1: Memory at febd9000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=4K]
        Region 2: I/O ports at ecc0 [size=32]
        Kernel modules: e1000e

The labeling can be done with these commands

pirqcon 33 system_u:object_r:nicP_t
iomemcon 0xfebe0-0xfebff system_u:object_r:nicP_t
iomemcon 0xfebd9 system_u:object_r:nicP_t
ioportcon 0xecc0-0xecdf system_u:object_r:nicP_t
pcidevicecon 0xc800 system_u:object_r:nicP_t

The PCI device label must be computed as the 32-bit SBDF number for the PCI
device. It the PCI device is aaaa:bb:cc.d or bb:cc.d, then the SBDF can be
calculated using:
	SBDF = (a << 16) | (b << 8) | (c << 3) | d

The AVC denials for IRQs, memory, ports, and PCI devices will normally contain
the ranges being denied to more easily determine what resources are required.
When running in permissive mode, only the first denial of a given
source/destination is printed to the log, so labeling devices using this method
may require multiple passes to find all required ranges.

Additional notes on XSM:FLASK
-----------------------------

1) xen command line parameters

	a) flask_enforcing
	
	The default value for flask_enforcing is '0'.  This parameter causes the 
	platform to boot in permissive mode which means that the policy is loaded 
	but not enforced.  This mode is often helpful for developing new systems 
	and policies as the policy violations are reported on the xen console and 
	may be viewed in dom0 through 'xl dmesg'.
	
	To boot the platform into enforcing mode, which means that the policy is
	loaded and enforced, append 'flask_enforcing=1' on the grub line.
	
	This parameter may also be changed through the flask hyercall.
	
	b) flask_enabled
	
	The default value for flask_enabled is '1'.  This parameter causes the
	platform to enable the FLASK security module under the XSM framework.
	The parameter may be enabled/disabled only once per boot.  If the parameter
	is set to '0', only a reboot can re-enable flask.  When flask_enabled is '0'
	the DUMMY module is enforced.

	This parameter may also be changed through the flask hypercall.  But may
	only be performed once per boot.
