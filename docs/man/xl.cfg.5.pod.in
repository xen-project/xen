=head1 NAME

xl.cfg - xl domain configuration file syntax

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 /etc/xen/xldomain

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Creating a VM (a domain in Xen terminology, sometimes called a guest)
with xl requires the provision of a domain configuration file.  Typically,
these live in F</etc/xen/DOMAIN.cfg>, where DOMAIN is the name of the
domain.

=head1 SYNTAX

A domain configuration file consists of a series of options, specified by
using C<KEY=VALUE> pairs.

Some C<KEY>s are mandatory, some are general options which apply to
any guest type, while others relate only to specific guest types
(e.g. PV or HVM guests).

A C<VALUE> can be one of:

=over 4

=item B<"STRING">

A string, surrounded by either single or double quotes. But if the
STRING is part of a SPEC_STRING, the quotes should be omitted.

=item B<NUMBER>

A number, in either decimal, octal (using a C<0> prefix) or
hexadecimal (using a C<0x> prefix) format.

=item B<BOOLEAN>

A C<NUMBER> interpreted as C<False> (C<0>) or C<True> (any other
value).

=item B<[ VALUE, VALUE, ... ]>

A list of C<VALUE>s of the above types. Lists can be heterogeneous and
nested.

=back

The semantics of each C<KEY> defines which type of C<VALUE> is required.

Pairs may be separated either by a newline or a semicolon.  Both
of the following are valid:

  name="h0"
  type="hvm"

  name="h0"; type="hvm"

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 Mandatory Configuration Items

The following key is mandatory for any guest type.

=over 4

=item B<name="NAME">

Specifies the name of the domain.  Names of domains existing on a
single host must be unique.

=back

=head2 Selecting Guest Type

=over 4

=item B<type="pv">

Specifies that this is to be a PV domain, suitable for hosting Xen-aware
guest operating systems. This is the default on x86.

=item B<type="pvh">

Specifies that this is to be an PVH domain. That is a lightweight HVM-like
guest without a device model and without many of the emulated devices
available to HVM guests. Note that this mode requires a PVH aware kernel on
x86. This is the default on Arm.

=item B<type="hvm">

Specifies that this is to be an HVM domain. That is, a fully virtualised
computer with emulated BIOS, disk and network peripherals, etc.

=back

=head3 Deprecated guest type selection

Note that the builder option is being deprecated in favor of the type
option.

=over 4

=item B<builder="generic">

Specifies that this is to be a PV domain, suitable for hosting Xen-aware guest
operating systems. This is the default.

=item B<builder="hvm">

Specifies that this is to be an HVM domain.  That is, a fully
virtualised computer with emulated BIOS, disk and network peripherals,
etc.

=back

=head2 General Options

The following options apply to guests of any type.

=head3 CPU Allocation

=over 4

=item B<pool="CPUPOOLNAME">

Put the guest's vCPUs into the named CPU pool.

=item B<vcpus=N>

Start the guest with N vCPUs initially online.

=item B<maxvcpus=M>

Allow the guest to bring up a maximum of M vCPUs. When starting the guest, if
B<vcpus=N> is less than B<maxvcpus=M> then the first B<N> vCPUs will be
created online and the remainder will be created offline.

=item B<cpus="CPULIST">

List of host CPUs the guest is allowed to use. Default is no pinning at
all (more on this below). A C<CPULIST> may be specified as follows:

=over 4

=item "all"

To allow all the vCPUs of the guest to run on all the CPUs on the host.

=item "0-3,5,^1"

To allow all the vCPUs of the guest to run on CPUs 0,2,3,5. It is possible to
combine this with "all", meaning "all,^7" results in all the vCPUs
of the guest being allowed to run on all the CPUs of the host except CPU 7.

=item "nodes:0-3,^node:2"

To allow all the vCPUs of the guest to run on the CPUs from NUMA nodes
0,1,3 of the host. So, if CPUs 0-3 belong to node 0, CPUs 4-7 belong
to node 1, CPUs 8-11 to node 2 and CPUs 12-15 to node 3, the above would mean
all the vCPUs of the guest would be allowed to run on CPUs 0-7,12-15.

Combining this notation with the one above is possible. For instance,
"1,node:1,^6", means all the vCPUs of the guest will run on CPU 1 and
on all the CPUs of NUMA node 1, but not on CPU 6. Following the same
example as above, that would be CPUs 1,4,5,7.

Combining this with "all" is also possible, meaning "all,^node:1"
results in all the vCPUs of the guest running on all the CPUs on the
host, except for the CPUs belonging to the host NUMA node 1.

=item ["2", "3-8,^5"]

To ask for specific vCPU mapping. That means (in this example), vCPU 0
of the guest will run on CPU 2 of the host and vCPU 1 of the guest will
run on CPUs 3,4,6,7,8 of the host (excluding CPU 5).

More complex notation can be also used, exactly as described above. So
"all,^5-8", or just "all", or "node:0,node:2,^9-11,18-20" are all legal,
for each element of the list.

=back

If this option is not specified, no vCPU to CPU pinning is established,
and the vCPUs of the guest can run on all the CPUs of the host. If this
option is specified, the intersection of the vCPU pinning mask, provided
here, and the soft affinity mask, if provided via B<cpus_soft=>,
is utilized to compute the domain node-affinity for driving memory
allocations.

=item B<cpus_soft="CPULIST">

Exactly as B<cpus=>, but specifies soft affinity, rather than pinning
(hard affinity). When using the credit scheduler, this means what CPUs
the vCPUs of the domain prefer.

A C<CPULIST> is specified exactly as for B<cpus=>, detailed earlier in the
manual.

If this option is not specified, the vCPUs of the guest will not have
any preference regarding host CPUs. If this option is specified,
the intersection of the soft affinity mask, provided here, and the vCPU
pinning, if provided via B<cpus=>, is utilized to compute the
domain node-affinity for driving memory allocations.

If this option is not specified (and B<cpus=> is not specified either),
libxl automatically tries to place the guest on the least possible
number of nodes. A heuristic approach is used for choosing the best
node (or set of nodes), with the goal of maximizing performance for
the guest and, at the same time, achieving efficient utilization of
host CPUs and memory. In that case, the soft affinity of all the vCPUs
of the domain will be set to host CPUs belonging to NUMA nodes
chosen during placement.

For more details, see L<xl-numa-placement(7)>.

=back

=head3 CPU Scheduling

=over 4

=item B<cpu_weight=WEIGHT>

A domain with a weight of 512 will get twice as much CPU as a domain
with a weight of 256 on a contended host.
Legal weights range from 1 to 65535 and the default is 256.
Honoured by the credit and credit2 schedulers.

=item B<cap=N>

The cap optionally fixes the maximum amount of CPU a domain will be
able to consume, even if the host system has idle CPU cycles.
The cap is expressed as a percentage of one physical CPU:
100 is 1 physical CPU, 50 is half a CPU, 400 is 4 CPUs, etc.
The default, 0, means there is no cap.
Honoured by the credit and credit2 schedulers.

B<NOTE>: Many systems have features that will scale down the computing
power of a CPU that is not 100% utilized.  This can be done in the
operating system, but can also sometimes be done below the operating system,
in the BIOS.  If you set a cap such that individual cores are running
at less than 100%, this may have an impact on the performance of your
workload over and above the impact of the cap. For example, if your
processor runs at 2GHz, and you cap a VM at 50%, the power management
system may also reduce the clock speed to 1GHz; the effect will be
that your VM gets 25% of the available power (50% of 1GHz) rather than
50% (50% of 2GHz).  If you are not getting the performance you expect,
look at performance and CPU frequency options in your operating system and
your BIOS.

=back

=head3 Memory Allocation

=over 4

=item B<memory=MBYTES>

Start the guest with MBYTES megabytes of RAM.

=item B<maxmem=MBYTES>

Specifies the maximum amount of memory a guest can ever see.
The value of B<maxmem=> must be equal to or greater than that of B<memory=>.

In combination with B<memory=> it will start the guest "pre-ballooned",
if the values of B<memory=> and B<maxmem=> differ.
A "pre-ballooned" HVM guest needs a balloon driver, without a balloon driver
it will crash.

B<NOTE>: Because of the way ballooning works, the guest has to allocate
memory to keep track of maxmem pages, regardless of how much memory it
actually has available to it.  A guest with maxmem=262144 and
memory=8096 will report significantly less memory available for use
than a system with maxmem=8096 memory=8096 due to the memory overhead
of having to track the unused pages.

=back

=head3 Guest Virtual NUMA Configuration

=over 4

=item B<vnuma=[ VNODE_SPEC, VNODE_SPEC, ... ]>

Specify virtual NUMA configuration with positional arguments. The
nth B<VNODE_SPEC> in the list specifies the configuration of the nth
virtual node.

Note that virtual NUMA is not supported for PV guests yet, because
there is an issue with the CPUID instruction handling that affects PV virtual
NUMA. Furthermore, guests with virtual NUMA cannot be saved or migrated
because the migration stream does not preserve node information.

Each B<VNODE_SPEC> is a list, which has a form of
"[VNODE_CONFIG_OPTION, VNODE_CONFIG_OPTION, ... ]"  (without the quotes).

For example, vnuma = [ ["pnode=0","size=512","vcpus=0-4","vdistances=10,20"] ]
means vnode 0 is mapped to pnode 0, has 512MB ram, has vcpus 0 to 4, the
distance to itself is 10 and the distance to vnode 1 is 20.

Each B<VNODE_CONFIG_OPTION> is a quoted C<KEY=VALUE> pair. Supported
B<VNODE_CONFIG_OPTION>s are (they are all mandatory at the moment):

=over 4

=item B<pnode=NUMBER>

Specifies which physical node this virtual node maps to.

=item B<size=MBYTES>

Specifies the size of this virtual node. The sum of memory sizes of all
vnodes will become B<maxmem=>. If B<maxmem=> is specified separately,
a check is performed to make sure the sum of all vnode memory matches
B<maxmem=>.

=item B<vcpus="CPUSTRING">

Specifies which vCPUs belong to this node. B<"CPUSTRING"> is a string of numerical
values separated by a comma. You can specify a range and/or a single CPU.
An example would be "vcpus=0-5,8", which means you specified vCPU 0 to vCPU 5,
and vCPU 8.

=item B<vdistances=NUMBER, NUMBER, ... >

Specifies the virtual distance from this node to all nodes (including
itself) with positional arguments. For example, "vdistance=10,20"
for vnode 0 means the distance from vnode 0 to vnode 0 is 10, from
vnode 0 to vnode 1 is 20. The number of arguments supplied must match
the total number of vnodes.

Normally you can use the values from B<xl info -n> or B<numactl
--hardware> to fill the vdistances list.

=back

=back

=head3 Event Actions

=over 4

=item B<on_poweroff="ACTION">

Specifies what should be done with the domain if it shuts itself down.
The B<ACTION>s are:

=over 4

=item B<destroy>

destroy the domain

=item B<restart>

destroy the domain and immediately create a new domain with the same
configuration

=item B<rename-restart>

rename the domain which terminated, and then immediately create a new
domain with the same configuration as the original

=item B<preserve>

keep the domain.  It can be examined, and later destroyed with B<xl destroy>.

=item B<coredump-destroy>

write a "coredump" of the domain to F<@XEN_DUMP_DIR@/NAME> and then
destroy the domain.

=item B<coredump-restart>

write a "coredump" of the domain to F<@XEN_DUMP_DIR@/NAME> and then
restart the domain.

=item B<soft-reset>

Reset all Xen specific interfaces for the Xen-aware HVM domain allowing
it to reestablish these interfaces and continue executing the domain. PV
and non-Xen-aware HVM guests are not supported.

=back

The default for B<on_poweroff> is B<destroy>.

=item B<on_reboot="ACTION">

Action to take if the domain shuts down with a reason code requesting
a reboot.  Default is B<restart>.

=item B<on_watchdog="ACTION">

Action to take if the domain shuts down due to a Xen watchdog timeout.
Default is B<destroy>.

=item B<on_crash="ACTION">

Action to take if the domain crashes.  Default is B<destroy>.

=item B<on_soft_reset="ACTION">

Action to take if the domain performs a 'soft reset' (e.g. does B<kexec>).
Default is B<soft-reset>.

=back

=head3 Direct Kernel Boot

Direct kernel boot allows booting guests with a kernel and an initrd
stored on a filesystem available to the host physical machine, allowing
command line arguments to be passed directly. PV guest direct kernel boot is
supported. HVM guest direct kernel boot is supported with some limitations
(it's supported when using B<qemu-xen> and the default BIOS 'seabios',
but not supported in case of using B<stubdom-dm> and the old 'rombios'.)

=over 4

=item B<kernel="PATHNAME">

Load the specified file as the kernel image.

=item B<ramdisk="PATHNAME">

Load the specified file as the ramdisk.

=item B<cmdline="STRING">

Append B<STRING> to the kernel command line. (Note: the meaning of
this is guest specific). It can replace B<root="STRING">
along with B<extra="STRING"> and is preferred. When B<cmdline="STRING"> is set,
B<root="STRING"> and B<extra="STRING"> will be ignored.

=item B<root="STRING">

Append B<root=STRING> to the kernel command line (Note: the meaning of this
is guest specific).

=item B<extra="STRING">

Append B<STRING> to the kernel command line. (Note: the meaning of this
is guest specific).

=back

=head3 Non direct Kernel Boot

Non direct kernel boot allows booting guests with a firmware. This can be
used by all types of guests, although the selection of options is different
depending on the guest type.

This option provides the flexibly of letting the guest decide which kernel
they want to boot, while preventing having to poke at the guest file
system form the toolstack domain.

=head4 PV guest options

=over 4

=item B<firmware="pvgrub32|pvgrub64">

Boots a guest using a para-virtualized version of grub that runs inside
of the guest. The bitness of the guest needs to be know, so that the right
version of pvgrub can be selected.

Note that xl expects to find the pvgrub32.bin and pvgrub64.bin binaries in
F<@XENFIRMWAREDIR@>.

=back

=head4 HVM guest options

=over 4

=item B<firmware="bios">

Boot the guest using the default BIOS firmware, which depends on the
chosen device model.

=item B<firmware="uefi">

Boot the guest using the default UEFI firmware, currently OVMF.

=item B<firmware="seabios">

Boot the guest using the SeaBIOS BIOS firmware.

=item B<firmware="rombios">

Boot the guest using the ROMBIOS BIOS firmware.

=item B<firmware="ovmf">

Boot the guest using the OVMF UEFI firmware.

=item B<firmware="PATH">

Load the specified file as firmware for the guest.

=back

=head4 PVH guest options

Currently there's no firmware available for PVH guests, they should be
booted using the B<Direct Kernel Boot> method or the B<bootloader> option.

=over 4

=item B<pvshim=BOOLEAN>

Whether to boot this guest as a PV guest within a PVH container.
Ie, the guest will experience a PV environment,
but
processor hardware extensions are used to
separate its address space
to mitigate the Meltdown attack (CVE-2017-5754).

Default is false.

=item B<pvshim_path="PATH">

The PV shim is a specially-built firmware-like executable
constructed from the hypervisor source tree.
This option specifies to use a non-default shim.
Ignored if pvhsim is false.

=item B<pvshim_cmdline="STRING">

Command line for the shim.
Default is "pv-shim console=xen,pv".
Ignored if pvhsim is false.

=item B<pvshim_extra="STRING">

Extra command line arguments for the shim.
If supplied, appended to the value for pvshim_cmdline.
Default is empty.
Ignored if pvhsim is false.

=back

=head3 Other Options

=over 4

=item B<uuid="UUID">

Specifies the UUID of the domain.  If not specified, a fresh unique
UUID will be generated.

=item B<seclabel="LABEL">

Assign an XSM security label to this domain.

=item B<init_seclabel="LABEL">

Specify an XSM security label used for this domain temporarily during
its build. The domain's XSM label will be changed to the execution
seclabel (specified by B<seclabel>) once the build is complete, prior to
unpausing the domain. With a properly constructed security policy (such
as nomigrate_t in the example policy), this can be used to build a
domain whose memory is not accessible to the toolstack domain.

=item B<max_grant_frames=NUMBER>

Specify the maximum number of grant frames the domain is allowed to have.
This value controls how many pages the domain is able to grant access to for
other domains, needed e.g. for the operation of paravirtualized devices.
The default is settable via L<xl.conf(5)>.

=item B<max_maptrack_frames=NUMBER>

Specify the maximum number of grant maptrack frames the domain is allowed
to have. This value controls how many pages of foreign domains can be accessed
via the grant mechanism by this domain. The default value is settable via
L<xl.conf(5)>.

=item B<nomigrate=BOOLEAN>

Disable migration of this domain.  This enables certain other features
which are incompatible with migration. Currently this is limited to
enabling the invariant TSC feature flag in CPUID results when TSC is
not emulated.

=item B<driver_domain=BOOLEAN>

Specify that this domain is a driver domain. This enables certain
features needed in order to run a driver domain.

=item B<device_tree=PATH>

Specify a partial device tree (compiled via the Device Tree Compiler).
Everything under the node "/passthrough" will be copied into the guest
device tree. For convenience, the node "/aliases" is also copied to allow
the user to define aliases which can be used by the guest kernel.

Given the complexity of verifying the validity of a device tree, this
option should only be used with a trusted device tree.

Note that the partial device tree should avoid using the phandle 65000
which is reserved by the toolstack.

=item B<passthrough="STRING">

Specify whether IOMMU mappings are enabled for the domain and hence whether
it will be enabled for passthrough hardware. Valid values for this option
are:

=over 4

=item B<disabled>

IOMMU mappings are disabled for the domain and so hardware may not be
passed through.

This option is the default if no passthrough hardware is specified in the
domain's configuration.

=item B<enabled>

This option enables IOMMU mappings and selects an appropriate default
operating mode (see below for details of the operating modes). For HVM/PVH
domains running on platforms where the option is available, this is
equivalent to B<share_pt>. Otherwise, and also for PV domains, this
option is equivalent to B<sync_pt>.

This option is the default if passthrough hardware is specified in the
domain's configuration.

=item B<sync_pt>

This option means that IOMMU mappings will be synchronized with the
domain's P2M table as follows:

For a PV domain, all writable pages assigned to the domain are identity
mapped by MFN in the IOMMU page table. Thus a device driver running in the
domain may program passthrough hardware for DMA using MFN values
(i.e. host/machine frame numbers) looked up in its P2M.

For an HVM/PVH domain, all non-foreign RAM pages present in its P2M will be
mapped by GFN in the IOMMU page table. Thus a device driver running in the
domain may program passthrough hardware using GFN values (i.e. guest
physical frame numbers) without any further translation.

This option is not currently available on Arm.

=item B<share_pt>

This option is unavailable for a PV domain. For an HVM/PVH domain, this
option means that the IOMMU will be programmed to directly reference the
domain's P2M table as its page table. From the point of view of a device
driver running in the domain this is functionally equivalent to B<sync_pt>
but places less load on the hypervisor and so should generally be selected
in preference. However, the availability of this option is hardware
specific. If B<xl info> reports B<virt_caps> containing
B<iommu_hap_pt_share> then this option may be used.

=item B<default>

The default, which chooses between B<disabled> and B<enabled>
according to whether passthrough devices are enabled in the config
file.

=back

=back

=head2 Devices

The following options define the paravirtual, emulated and physical
devices which the guest will contain.

=over 4

=item B<disk=[ "DISK_SPEC_STRING", "DISK_SPEC_STRING", ...]>

Specifies the disks (both emulated disks and Xen virtual block
devices) which are to be provided to the guest, and what objects on
the host they should map to.  See L<xl-disk-configuration(5)> for more
details.

=item B<vif=[ "NET_SPEC_STRING", "NET_SPEC_STRING", ...]>

Specifies the network interfaces (both emulated network adapters,
and Xen virtual interfaces) which are to be provided to the guest.  See
L<xl-network-configuration(5)> for more details.

=item B<vtpm=[ "VTPM_SPEC_STRING", "VTPM_SPEC_STRING", ...]>

Specifies the Virtual Trusted Platform module to be
provided to the guest. See L<xen-vtpm(7)> for more details.

Each B<VTPM_SPEC_STRING> is a comma-separated list of C<KEY=VALUE>
settings from the following list:

=over 4

=item B<backend=domain-id>

Specifies the backend domain name or id. B<This value is required!>
If this domain is a guest, the backend should be set to the
vTPM domain name. If this domain is a vTPM, the
backend should be set to the vTPM manager domain name.

=item B<uuid=UUID>

Specifies the UUID of this vTPM device. The UUID is used to uniquely
identify the vTPM device. You can create one using the B<uuidgen(1)>
program on unix systems. If left unspecified, a new UUID
will be randomly generated every time the domain boots.
If this is a vTPM domain, you should specify a value. The
value is optional if this is a guest domain.

=back

=item B<p9=[ "9PFS_SPEC_STRING", "9PFS_SPEC_STRING", ...]>

Creates a Xen 9pfs connection to share a filesystem from the backend to the
frontend.

Each B<9PFS_SPEC_STRING> is a comma-separated list of C<KEY=VALUE>
settings, from the following list:

=over 4

=item B<tag=STRING>

9pfs tag to identify the filesystem share. The tag is needed on the
guest side to mount it.

=item B<security_model="none">

Only "none" is supported today, which means that the files are stored using
the same credentials as those they have in the guest (no user ownership
squash or remap).

=item B<path=STRING>

Filesystem path on the backend to export.

=item B<backend=domain-id>

Specify the backend domain name or id, defaults to dom0.

=back

=item B<pvcalls=[ "backend=domain-id", ... ]>

Creates a Xen pvcalls connection to handle pvcalls requests from
frontend to backend. It can be used as an alternative networking model.
For more information about the protocol, see
https://xenbits.xenproject.org/docs/unstable/misc/pvcalls.html.

=item B<vfb=[ "VFB_SPEC_STRING", "VFB_SPEC_STRING", ...]>

Specifies the paravirtual framebuffer devices which should be supplied
to the domain.

This option does not control the emulated graphics card presented to
an HVM guest. See B<Emulated VGA Graphics Device> below for how to
configure the emulated device. If B<Emulated VGA Graphics Device> options
are used in a PV guest configuration, B<xl> will pick up B<vnc>, B<vnclisten>,
B<vncpasswd>, B<vncdisplay>, B<vncunused>, B<sdl>, B<opengl> and
B<keymap> to construct the paravirtual framebuffer device for the guest.

Each B<VFB_SPEC_STRING> is a comma-separated list of C<KEY=VALUE>
settings, from the following list:

=over 4

=item B<vnc=BOOLEAN>

Allow access to the display via the VNC protocol.  This enables the
other VNC-related settings.  Default is 1 (enabled).

=item B<vnclisten=ADDRESS[:DISPLAYNUM]>

Specifies the IP address, and optionally the VNC display number, to use.

Note: if you specify the display number here, you should not use
the B<vncdisplay> option.

=item B<vncdisplay=DISPLAYNUM>

Specifies the VNC display number to use.  The actual TCP port number
will be DISPLAYNUM+5900.

Note: you should not use this option if you set the DISPLAYNUM in the
B<vnclisten> option.

=item B<vncunused=BOOLEAN>

Requests that the VNC display setup searches for a free TCP port to use.
The actual display used can be accessed with B<xl vncviewer>.

=item B<vncpasswd=PASSWORD>

Specifies the password for the VNC server. If the password is set to an
empty string, authentication on the VNC server will be disabled,
allowing any user to connect.

=item B<sdl=BOOLEAN>

Specifies that the display should be presented via an X window (using
Simple DirectMedia Layer). The default is 0 (not enabled).

=item B<display=DISPLAY>

Specifies the X Window display that should be used when the B<sdl> option
is used.

=item B<xauthority=XAUTHORITY>

Specifies the path to the X authority file that should be used to
connect to the X server when the B<sdl> option is used.

=item B<opengl=BOOLEAN>

Enable OpenGL acceleration of the SDL display. Only effects machines
using B<device_model_version="qemu-xen-traditional"> and only if the
device-model was compiled with OpenGL support. The default is 0 (disabled).

=item B<keymap=LANG>

Configure the keymap to use for the keyboard associated with this
display. If the input method does not easily support raw keycodes
(e.g. this is often the case when using VNC) then this allows us to
correctly map the input keys into keycodes seen by the guest. The
specific values which are accepted are defined by the version of the
device-model which you are using. See B<Keymaps> below or consult the
B<qemu(1)> manpage. The default is B<en-us>.

=back

=item B<channel=[ "CHANNEL_SPEC_STRING", "CHANNEL_SPEC_STRING", ...]>

Specifies the virtual channels to be provided to the guest. A
channel is a low-bandwidth, bidirectional byte stream, which resembles
a serial link. Typical uses for channels include transmitting VM
configuration after boot and signalling to in-guest agents. Please see
L<xen-pv-channel(7)> for more details.

Each B<CHANNEL_SPEC_STRING> is a comma-separated list of C<KEY=VALUE>
settings. Leading and trailing whitespace is ignored in both KEY and
VALUE. Neither KEY nor VALUE may contain ',', '=' or '"'. Defined values
are:

=over 4

=item B<backend=domain-id>

Specifies the backend domain name or id. This parameter is optional. If
this parameter is omitted then the toolstack domain will be assumed.

=item B<name=NAME>

Specifies the name for this device. B<This parameter is mandatory!>
This should be a well-known name for a specific application (e.g.
guest agent) and should be used by the frontend to connect the
application to the right channel device. There is no formal registry
of channel names, so application authors are encouraged to make their
names unique by including the domain name and a version number in the string
(e.g. org.mydomain.guestagent.1).

=item B<connection=CONNECTION>

Specifies how the backend will be implemented. The following options are
available:

=over 4

=item B<SOCKET>

The backend will bind a Unix domain socket (at the path given by
B<path=PATH>), listen for and accept connections. The backend will proxy
data between the channel and the connected socket.

=item B<PTY>

The backend will create a pty and proxy data between the channel and the
master device. The command B<xl channel-list> can be used to discover the
assigned slave device.

=back

=back

=item B<rdm="RDM_RESERVATION_STRING">

B<HVM/x86 only!> Specifies information about Reserved Device Memory (RDM),
which is necessary to enable robust device passthrough. One example of RDM
is reporting through the ACPI Reserved Memory Region Reporting (RMRR) structure
on the x86 platform.

B<RDM_RESERVATION_STRING> is a comma separated list of C<KEY=VALUE> settings,
from the following list:

=over 4

=item B<strategy=STRING>

Currently there is only one valid type, and that is "host".

=over 4

=item B<host>

If set to "host" it means all reserved device memory on this platform should
be checked to reserve regions in this VM's address space. This global RDM
parameter allows the user to specify reserved regions explicitly, and using
"host" includes all reserved regions reported on this platform, which is
useful when doing hotplug.

By default this isn't set so we don't check all RDMs. Instead, we just check
the RDM specific to a given device if we're assigning this kind of a device.

Note: this option is not recommended unless you can make sure that no
conflicts exist.

For example, you're trying to set "memory = 2800" to allocate memory to one
given VM but the platform owns two RDM regions like:

Device A [sbdf_A]: RMRR region_A: base_addr ac6d3000 end_address ac6e6fff

Device B [sbdf_B]: RMRR region_B: base_addr ad800000 end_address afffffff

In this conflict case,

#1. If B<strategy> is set to "host", for example:

rdm = "strategy=host,policy=strict" or rdm = "strategy=host,policy=relaxed"

it means all conflicts will be handled according to the policy
introduced by B<policy> as described below.

#2. If B<strategy> is not set at all, but

pci = [ 'sbdf_A, rdm_policy=xxxxx' ]

it means only one conflict of region_A will be handled according to the policy
introduced by B<rdm_policy=STRING> as described inside B<pci> options.

=back

=item B<policy=STRING>

Specifies how to deal with conflicts when reserving already reserved device
memory in the guest address space.

=over 4

=item B<strict>

Specifies that in case of an unresolved conflict the VM can't be created,
or the associated device can't be attached in the case of hotplug.

=item B<relaxed>

Specifies that in case of an unresolved conflict the VM is allowed to be
created but may cause the VM to crash if a pass-through device accesses RDM.
For example, the Windows IGD GFX driver always accesses RDM regions so it
leads to a VM crash.

Note: this may be overridden by the B<rdm_policy> option in the B<pci>
device configuration.

=back

=back

=item B<usbctrl=[ "USBCTRL_SPEC_STRING", "USBCTRL_SPEC_STRING", ...]>

Specifies the USB controllers created for this guest.

Each B<USBCTRL_SPEC_STRING> is a comma-separated list of C<KEY=VALUE>
settings, from the following list:

=over 4

=item B<type=TYPE>

Specifies the usb controller type.

=over 4

=item B<pv>

Specifies a kernel based PVUSB backend.

=item B<qusb>

Specifies a QEMU based PVUSB backend.

=item B<devicemodel>

Specifies a USB controller emulated by QEMU.
It will show up as a PCI-device in the guest.

=item B<auto>

Determines whether a kernel based backend is installed.
If this is the case, B<pv> is used, otherwise B<qusb> will be used.
For HVM domains B<devicemodel> will be selected.

This option is the default.

=back

=item B<version=VERSION>

Specifies the usb controller version.  Possible values include
1 (USB1.1), 2 (USB2.0) and 3 (USB3.0).
Default is 2 (USB2.0).
Value 3 (USB3.0) is available for the B<devicemodel> type only.

=item B<ports=PORTS>

Specifies the total number of ports of the usb controller. The maximum
number is 31. The default is 8.
With the type B<devicemodel> the number of ports is more limited:
a USB1.1 controller always has 2 ports,
a USB2.0 controller always has 6 ports
and a USB3.0 controller can have up to 15 ports.

USB controller ids start from 0.  In line with the USB specification, however,
ports on a controller start from 1.

B<EXAMPLE>

=over 2

usbctrl=["version=1,ports=4", "version=2,ports=8"]

The first controller is USB1.1 and has:

controller id = 0, and ports 1,2,3,4.

The second controller is USB2.0 and has:

controller id = 1, and ports 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

=back

=back

=item B<usbdev=[ "USBDEV_SPEC_STRING", "USBDEV_SPEC_STRING", ...]>

Specifies the USB devices to be attached to the guest at boot.

Each B<USBDEV_SPEC_STRING> is a comma-separated list of C<KEY=VALUE>
settings, from the following list:

=over 4

=item B<type=hostdev>

Specifies USB device type. Currently only "hostdev" is supported.

=item B<hostbus=busnum>

Specifies busnum of the USB device from the host perspective.

=item B<hostaddr=devnum>

Specifies devnum of the USB device from the host perspective.

=item B<controller=CONTROLLER>

Specifies the USB controller id, to which controller the USB device is
attached.

If no controller is specified, an available controller:port combination
will be used.  If there are no available controller:port combinations,
a new controller will be created.

=item B<port=PORT>

Specifies the USB port to which the USB device is attached. The B<port>
option is valid only when the B<controller> option is specified.

=back

=item B<pci=[ "PCI_SPEC_STRING", "PCI_SPEC_STRING", ...]>

Specifies the host PCI devices to passthrough to this guest.
Each B<PCI_SPEC_STRING> has the form of
B<[DDDD:]BB:DD.F[@VSLOT],KEY=VALUE,KEY=VALUE,...> where:

=over 4

=item B<[DDDD:]BB:DD.F>

Identifies the PCI device from the host perspective in the domain
(B<DDDD>), Bus (B<BB>), Device (B<DD>) and Function (B<F>) syntax. This is
the same scheme as used in the output of B<lspci(1)> for the device in
question.

Note: by default B<lspci(1)> will omit the domain (B<DDDD>) if it
is zero and it is optional here also. You may specify the function
(B<F>) as B<*> to indicate all functions.

=item B<@VSLOT>

Specifies the virtual slot where the guest will see this
device. This is equivalent to the B<DD> which the guest sees. In a
guest B<DDDD> and B<BB> are C<0000:00>.

=item B<permissive=BOOLEAN>

By default pciback only allows PV guests to write "known safe" values
into PCI configuration space, likewise QEMU (both qemu-xen and
qemu-xen-traditional) imposes the same constraint on HVM guests.
However, many devices require writes to other areas of the configuration space
in order to operate properly.  This option tells the backend (pciback or QEMU)
to allow all writes to the PCI configuration space of this device by this
domain.

B<This option should be enabled with caution:> it gives the guest much
more control over the device, which may have security or stability
implications.  It is recommended to only enable this option for
trusted VMs under administrator's control.

=item B<msitranslate=BOOLEAN>

Specifies that MSI-INTx translation should be turned on for the PCI
device. When enabled, MSI-INTx translation will always enable MSI on
the PCI device regardless of whether the guest uses INTx or MSI. Some
device drivers, such as NVIDIA's, detect an inconsistency and do not
function when this option is enabled. Therefore the default is false (0).

=item B<seize=BOOLEAN>

Tells B<xl> to automatically attempt to re-assign a device to
pciback if it is not already assigned.

B<WARNING:> If you set this option, B<xl> will gladly re-assign a critical
system device, such as a network or a disk controller being used by
dom0 without confirmation.  Please use with care.

=item B<power_mgmt=BOOLEAN>

B<(HVM only)> Specifies that the VM should be able to program the
D0-D3hot power management states for the PCI device. The default is false (0).

=item B<rdm_policy=STRING>

B<(HVM/x86 only)> This is the same as the policy setting inside the B<rdm>
option but just specific to a given device. The default is "relaxed".

Note: this would override global B<rdm> option.

=back

=item B<pci_permissive=BOOLEAN>

Changes the default value of B<permissive> for all PCI devices passed
through to this VM. See B<permissive> above.

=item B<pci_msitranslate=BOOLEAN>

Changes the default value of B<msitranslate> for all PCI devices passed
through to this VM. See B<msitranslate> above.

=item B<pci_seize=BOOLEAN>

Changes the default value of B<seize> for all PCI devices passed
through to this VM. See B<seize> above.

=item B<pci_power_mgmt=BOOLEAN>

B<(HVM only)> Changes the default value of B<power_mgmt> for all PCI
devices passed through to this VM. See B<power_mgmt>
above.

=item B<gfx_passthru=BOOLEAN|"STRING">

Enable graphics device PCI passthrough. This option makes an assigned
PCI graphics card become the primary graphics card in the VM. The QEMU
emulated graphics adapter is disabled and the VNC console for the VM
will not have any graphics output. All graphics output, including boot
time QEMU BIOS messages from the VM, will go to the physical outputs
of the passed through physical graphics card.

The graphics card PCI device to pass through is chosen with the B<pci>
option, in exactly the same way a normal Xen PCI device
passthrough/assignment is done.  Note that B<gfx_passthru> does not do
any kind of sharing of the GPU, so you can assign the GPU to only one
single VM at a time.

B<gfx_passthru> also enables various legacy VGA memory ranges, BARs, MMIOs,
and ioports to be passed through to the VM, since those are required
for correct operation of things like VGA BIOS, text mode, VBE, etc.

Enabling the B<gfx_passthru> option also copies the physical graphics card
video BIOS to the guest memory, and executes the VBIOS in the guest
to initialize the graphics card.

Most graphics adapters require vendor specific tweaks for properly
working graphics passthrough. See the XenVGAPassthroughTestedAdapters
L<https://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/XenVGAPassthroughTestedAdapters> wiki page
for graphics cards currently supported by B<gfx_passthru>.

B<gfx_passthru> is currently supported both with the qemu-xen-traditional
device-model and upstream qemu-xen device-model.

When given as a boolean the B<gfx_passthru> option either disables graphics
card passthrough or enables autodetection.

When given as a string the B<gfx_passthru> option describes the type
of device to enable. Note that this behavior is only supported with the
upstream qemu-xen device-model. With qemu-xen-traditional IGD (Intel Graphics
Device) is always assumed and options other than autodetect or explicit IGD
will result in an error.

Currently, valid values for the option are:

=over 4

=item B<0>

Disables graphics device PCI passthrough.

=item B<1>, B<"default">

Enables graphics device PCI passthrough and autodetects the type of device
which is being used.

=item B<"igd">

Enables graphics device PCI passthrough but forcing the type of device to
Intel Graphics Device.

=back

Note that some graphics cards (AMD/ATI cards, for example) do not
necessarily require the B<gfx_passthru> option, so you can use the normal Xen
PCI passthrough to assign the graphics card as a secondary graphics
card to the VM. The QEMU-emulated graphics card remains the primary
graphics card, and VNC output is available from the QEMU-emulated
primary adapter.

More information about the Xen B<gfx_passthru> feature is available
on the XenVGAPassthrough L<https://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/XenVGAPassthrough>
wiki page.

=item B<rdm_mem_boundary=MBYTES>

Number of megabytes to set for a boundary when checking for RDM conflicts.

When RDM conflicts with RAM, RDM is probably scattered over the whole RAM
space. Having multiple RDM entries would worsen this and lead to a complicated
memory layout. Here we're trying to figure out a simple solution to
avoid breaking the existing layout. When a conflict occurs,

    #1. Above a predefined boundary
        - move lowmem_end below the reserved region to solve the conflict;

    #2. Below a predefined boundary
        - Check if the policy is strict or relaxed.
        A "strict" policy leads to a fail in libxl.
        Note that when both policies are specified on a given region,
        "strict" is always preferred.
        The "relaxed" policy issues a warning message and also masks this
        entry INVALID to indicate we shouldn't expose this entry to
        hvmloader.

The default value is 2048.

=item B<dtdev=[ "DTDEV_PATH", "DTDEV_PATH", ...]>

Specifies the host device tree nodes to passt hrough to this guest. Each
DTDEV_PATH is an absolute path in the device tree.

=item B<ioports=[ "IOPORT_RANGE", "IOPORT_RANGE", ...]>

Allow the guest to access specific legacy I/O ports. Each B<IOPORT_RANGE>
is given in hexadecimal format and may either be a range, e.g. C<2f8-2ff>
(inclusive), or a single I/O port, e.g. C<2f8>.

It is recommended to only use this option for trusted VMs under
administrator's control.

=item B<iomem=[ "IOMEM_START,NUM_PAGES[@GFN]", "IOMEM_START,NUM_PAGES[@GFN]", ...]>

Allow auto-translated domains to access specific hardware I/O memory pages.

B<IOMEM_START> is a physical page number. B<NUM_PAGES> is the number of pages,
beginning with B<START_PAGE>, to allow access to. B<GFN> specifies the guest
frame number where the mapping will start in the guest's address space. If
B<GFN> is not specified, the mapping will be performed using B<IOMEM_START>
as a start in the guest's address space, therefore performing a 1:1 mapping
by default.
All of these values must be given in hexadecimal format.

Note that the IOMMU won't be updated with the mappings specified with this
option. This option therefore should not be used to pass through any
IOMMU-protected devices.

It is recommended to only use this option for trusted VMs under
administrator's control.

=item B<irqs=[ NUMBER, NUMBER, ...]>

Allow a guest to access specific physical IRQs.

It is recommended to only use this option for trusted VMs under
administrator's control.

If vuart console is enabled then irq 32 is reserved for it. See
L</vuart="uart"> to know how to enable vuart console.

=item B<max_event_channels=N>

Limit the guest to using at most N event channels (PV interrupts).
Guests use hypervisor resources for each event channel they use.

The default of 1023 should be sufficient for typical guests.  The
maximum value depends on what the guest supports.  Guests supporting the
FIFO-based event channel ABI support up to 131,071 event channels.
Other guests are limited to 4095 (64-bit x86 and ARM) or 1023 (32-bit
x86).

=item B<vdispl=[ "VDISPL_SPEC_STRING", "VDISPL_SPEC_STRING", ...]>

Specifies the backend domain name or id. If not specified Domain-0 is used.

=item C<be-alloc=BOOLEAN>

Indicates if backend can be a buffer provider/allocator for this domain. See
display protocol for details.

=item C<connectors=CONNECTORS>

Specifies virtual connectors for the device in following format
<id>:<W>x<H>;<id>:<W>x<H>... where:

and current limitations.

This feature is a B<technology preview>.
See SUPPORT.md for a security support statement.

=item B<device_model_user=USERNAME>

When running dm_restrict, run the device model as this user.

NOTE: Each domain MUST have a SEPARATE username.

See docs/features/qemu-depriv.pandoc for more information.

=item B<vsnd=[ VCARD_SPEC, VCARD_SPEC, ... ]>

Specifies the virtual sound cards to be provided to the guest.
Each B<VCARD_SPEC> is a list, which has a form of
"[VSND_ITEM_SPEC, VSND_ITEM_SPEC, ... ]" (without the quotes).
The virtual sound card has hierarchical structure.
Every card has a set of PCM devices and streams, each could be individually
configured.

B<VSND_ITEM_SPEC> describes individual item parameters.
B<VSND_ITEM_SPEC> is a string of comma separated item parameters
headed by item identifier. Each item parameter is C<KEY=VALUE> pair:

=over 4

"identifier, param = value, ...".

=back

Identifier shall be one of following values: "CARD", "PCM", "STREAM".
The child item treated as belonging to the previously defined parent item.

All parameters are optional.

There are group of parameters which are common for all items.
This group can be defined at higher level of the hierarchy and be fully or
partially re-used by the underlying layers. These parameters are:

=over 4

* number of channels (min/max)

* supported sample rates

* supported sample formats

=back

E.g. one can define these values for the whole card, device or stream.
Every underlying layer in turn can re-define some or all of them to better
fit its needs. For example, card may define number of channels to be
in [1; 8] range, and some particular stream may be limited to [1; 2] only.
The rule is that the underlying layer must be a subset of the upper layer
range.

=head2 Paravirtualised (PV) Guest Specific Options

The following options apply only to Paravirtual (PV) guests.

=over 4

=item B<bootloader="PROGRAM">

Run C<PROGRAM> to find the kernel image and ramdisk to use.  Normally
C<PROGRAM> would be C<pygrub>, which is an emulation of
grub/grub2/syslinux. Either B<kernel> or B<bootloader> must be specified
for PV guests.

=item B<bootloader_args=[ "ARG", "ARG", ...]>

Append B<ARG>s to the arguments to the B<bootloader>
program. Alternatively if the argument is a simple string then it will
be split into words at whitespace B<(this second option is deprecated)>.

=item B<e820_host=BOOLEAN>

Selects whether to expose the host e820 (memory map) to the guest via
the virtual e820. When this option is false (0) the guest pseudo-physical
address space consists of a single contiguous RAM region. When this
option is specified the virtual e820 instead reflects the host e820
and contains the same PCI holes. The total amount of RAM represented
by the memory map is always the same, this option configures only how
it is laid out.

Exposing the host e820 to the guest gives the guest kernel the
opportunity to set aside the required part of its pseudo-physical
address space in order to provide address space to map passedthrough
PCI devices. It is guest Operating System dependent whether this
option is required, specifically it is required when using a mainline
Linux ("pvops") kernel. This option defaults to true (1) if any PCI
passthrough devices are configured and false (0) otherwise. If you do not
configure any passthrough devices at domain creation time but expect
to hotplug devices later then you should set this option. Conversely
if your particular guest kernel does not require this behaviour then
it is safe to allow this to be enabled but you may wish to disable it
anyway.

=back

=head2 Fully-virtualised (HVM) Guest Specific Options

The following options apply only to Fully-virtualised (HVM) guests.

=head3 Boot Device

=over 4

=item B<boot="STRING">

Specifies the emulated virtual device to boot from.

Possible values are:

=over 4

=item B<c>

Hard disk.

=item B<d>

CD-ROM.

=item B<n>

Network / PXE.

=back

B<Note:> multiple options can be given and will be attempted in the order they
are given, e.g. to boot from CD-ROM but fall back to the hard disk you can
specify it as B<dc>.

The default is B<cd>, meaning try booting from the hard disk first, but fall
back to the CD-ROM.


=back

=head3 Emulated disk controller type

=over 4

=item B<hdtype=STRING>

Specifies the hard disk type.

Possible values are:

=over 4

=item B<ide>

If thise mode is specified B<xl> adds an emulated IDE controller, which is
suitable even for older operation systems.

=item B<ahci>

If this mode is specified, B<xl> adds an ich9 disk controller in AHCI mode and
uses it with upstream QEMU to emulate disks instead of IDE. It decreases boot
time but may not be supported by default in older operating systems, e.g.
Windows XP.

=back

The default is B<ide>.

=back

=head3 Paging

The following options control the mechanisms used to virtualise guest
memory.  The defaults are selected to give the best results for the
common cases so you should normally leave these options
unspecified.

=over 4

=item B<hap=BOOLEAN>

Turns "hardware assisted paging" (the use of the hardware nested page
table feature) on or off.  This feature is called EPT (Extended Page
Tables) by Intel and NPT (Nested Page Tables) or RVI (Rapid
Virtualisation Indexing) by AMD. If turned
off, Xen will run the guest in "shadow page table" mode where the
guest's page table updates and/or TLB flushes etc. will be emulated.
Use of HAP is the default when available.

=item B<oos=BOOLEAN>

Turns "out of sync pagetables" on or off.  When running in shadow page
table mode, the guest's page table updates may be deferred as
specified in the Intel/AMD architecture manuals.  However, this may
expose unexpected bugs in the guest, or find bugs in Xen, so it is
possible to disable this feature.  Use of out of sync page tables,
when Xen thinks it appropriate, is the default.

=item B<shadow_memory=MBYTES>

Number of megabytes to set aside for shadowing guest pagetable pages
(effectively acting as a cache of translated pages) or to use for HAP
state. By default this is 1MB per guest vCPU plus 8KB per MB of guest
RAM. You should not normally need to adjust this value. However, if you
are not using hardware assisted paging (i.e. you are using shadow
mode) and your guest workload consists of a very large number of
similar processes then increasing this value may improve performance.

=back

=head3 Processor and Platform Features

The following options allow various processor and platform level
features to be hidden or exposed from the guest's point of view. This
can be useful when running older guest Operating Systems which may
misbehave when faced with more modern features. In general, you should
accept the defaults for these options wherever possible.

=over 4

=item B<bios="STRING">

Select the virtual firmware that is exposed to the guest.
By default, a guess is made based on the device model, but sometimes
it may be useful to request a different one, like UEFI.

=over 4

=item B<rombios>

Loads ROMBIOS, a 16-bit x86 compatible BIOS. This is used by default
when B<device_model_version=qemu-xen-traditional>. This is the only BIOS
option supported when B<device_model_version=qemu-xen-traditional>. This is
the BIOS used by all previous Xen versions.

=item B<seabios>

Loads SeaBIOS, a 16-bit x86 compatible BIOS. This is used by default
with device_model_version=qemu-xen.

=item B<ovmf>

Loads OVMF, a standard UEFI firmware by Tianocore project.
Requires device_model_version=qemu-xen.

=back

=item B<bios_path_override="PATH">

Override the path to the blob to be used as BIOS. The blob provided here MUST
be consistent with the B<bios=> which you have specified. You should not
normally need to specify this option.

This option does not have any effect if using B<bios="rombios"> or
B<device_model_version="qemu-xen-traditional">.

=item B<pae=BOOLEAN>

Hide or expose the IA32 Physical Address Extensions. These extensions
make it possible for a 32 bit guest Operating System to access more
than 4GB of RAM. Enabling PAE also enabled other features such as
NX. PAE is required if you wish to run a 64-bit guest Operating
System. In general, you should leave this enabled and allow the guest
Operating System to choose whether or not to use PAE. (X86 only)

=item B<acpi=BOOLEAN>

Expose ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) tables from
the virtual firmware to the guest Operating System. ACPI is required
by most modern guest Operating Systems. This option is enabled by
default and usually you should omit it. However, it may be necessary to
disable ACPI for compatibility with some guest Operating Systems.
This option is true for x86 while it's false for ARM by default.

=item B<acpi_s3=BOOLEAN>

Include the S3 (suspend-to-ram) power state in the virtual firmware
ACPI table. True (1) by default.

=item B<acpi_s4=BOOLEAN>

Include S4 (suspend-to-disk) power state in the virtual firmware ACPI
table. True (1) by default.

=item B<acpi_laptop_slate=BOOLEAN>

Include the Windows laptop/slate mode switch device in the virtual
firmware ACPI table. False (0) by default.

=item B<apic=BOOLEAN>

B<(x86 only)> Include information regarding APIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt
Controller) in the firmware/BIOS tables on a single processor
guest. This causes the MP (multiprocessor) and PIR (PCI Interrupt
Routing) tables to be exported by the virtual firmware. This option
has no effect on a guest with multiple virtual CPUs as they must
always include these tables. This option is enabled by default and you
should usually omit it but it may be necessary to disable these
firmware tables when using certain older guest Operating
Systems. These tables have been superseded by newer constructs within
the ACPI tables.

=item B<nx=BOOLEAN>

B<(x86 only)> Hides or exposes the No-eXecute capability. This allows a guest
Operating System to map pages in such a way that they cannot be executed which
can enhance security. This options requires that PAE also be
enabled.

=item B<hpet=BOOLEAN>

B<(x86 only)> Enables or disables HPET (High Precision Event Timer). This
option is enabled by default and you should usually omit it.
It may be necessary to disable the HPET in order to improve compatibility with
guest Operating Systems.

=item B<altp2m="MODE">

B<(x86 only)> Specifies the access mode to the alternate-p2m capability.
Alternate-p2m allows a guest to manage multiple p2m guest physical "memory
views" (as opposed to a single p2m).
You may want this option if you want to access-control/isolate
access to specific guest physical memory pages accessed by the guest, e.g. for
domain memory introspection or for isolation/access-control of memory between
components within a single guest domain. This option is disabled by default.

The valid values are as follows:

=over 4

=item B<disabled>

Altp2m is disabled for the domain (default).

=item B<mixed>

The mixed mode allows access to the altp2m interface for both in-guest
and external tools as well.

=item B<external>

Enables access to the alternate-p2m capability by external privileged tools.

=item B<limited>

Enables limited access to the alternate-p2m capability,
ie. giving the guest access only to enable/disable the VMFUNC and #VE features.

=back

=item B<altp2mhvm=BOOLEAN>

Enables or disables HVM guest access to alternate-p2m capability.
Alternate-p2m allows a guest to manage multiple p2m guest physical
"memory views" (as opposed to a single p2m). This option is
disabled by default and is available only to HVM domains.
You may want this option if you want to access-control/isolate
access to specific guest physical memory pages accessed by
the guest, e.g. for HVM domain memory introspection or
for isolation/access-control of memory between components within
a single guest HVM domain. B<This option is deprecated, use the option
"altp2m" instead.>

B<Note>: While the option "altp2mhvm" is deprecated, legacy applications for
x86 systems will continue to work using it.

=item B<nestedhvm=BOOLEAN>

Enable or disables guest access to hardware virtualisation features,
e.g. it allows a guest Operating System to also function as a
hypervisor. You may want this
option if you want to run another hypervisor (including another copy
of Xen) within a Xen guest or to support a guest Operating System
which uses hardware virtualisation extensions (e.g. Windows XP
compatibility mode on more modern Windows OS).
This option is disabled by default.

=item B<cpuid="LIBXL_STRING"> or B<cpuid=[ "XEND_STRING", "XEND_STRING" ]>

Configure the value returned when a guest executes the CPUID instruction.
Two versions of config syntax are recognized: libxl and xend.

The libxl syntax is a comma separated list of key=value pairs, preceded by the
word "host". A few keys take a numerical value, all others take a single
character which describes what to do with the feature bit.

Possible values for a single feature bit:
  '1' -> force the corresponding bit to 1
  '0' -> force to 0
  'x' -> Get a safe value (pass through and mask with the default policy)
  'k' -> pass through the host bit value
  's' -> as 'k' but preserve across save/restore and migration (not implemented)

Note: when specifying B<cpuid> for hypervisor leaves (0x4000xxxx major group)
only the lowest 8 bits of leaf's 0x4000xx00 EAX register are processed, the
rest are ignored (these 8 bits signify maximum number of hypervisor leaves).

List of keys taking a value:

The xend syntax is a list of values in the form of
'leafnum:register=bitstring,register=bitstring'
  "leafnum" is the requested function,
  "register" is the response register to modify
  "bitstring" represents all bits in the register, its length must be 32 chars.
  Each successive character represent a lesser-significant bit, possible values
  are listed above in the libxl section.

Example to hide two features from the guest: 'tm', which is bit #29 in EDX, and
'pni' (SSE3), which is bit #0 in ECX:

xend: [ "1:ecx=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx0,edx=xx0xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" ]

libxl: "host,tm=0,sse3=0"

More info about the CPUID instruction can be found in the processor manuals,
and on Wikipedia: L<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPUID>

=item B<acpi_firmware="STRING">

Specifies a path to a file that contains extra ACPI firmware tables to pass into
a guest. The file can contain several tables in their binary AML form
concatenated together. Each table self describes its length so no additional
information is needed. These tables will be added to the ACPI table set in the
guest. Note that existing tables cannot be overridden by this feature. For
example, this cannot be used to override tables like DSDT, FADT, etc.

=item B<smbios_firmware="STRING">

Specifies a path to a file that contains extra SMBIOS firmware structures to
pass into a guest. The file can contain a set of DMTF predefined structures
which will override the internal defaults. Not all predefined structures can be
overridden,
only the following types: 0, 1, 2, 3, 11, 22, 39. The file can also contain any
number of vendor defined SMBIOS structures (type 128 - 255). Since SMBIOS
structures do not present their overall size, each entry in the file must be
preceded by a 32b integer indicating the size of the following structure.

=item B<ms_vm_genid="OPTION">

Provide a VM generation ID to the guest.

The VM generation ID is a 128-bit random number that a guest may use
to determine if the guest has been restored from an earlier snapshot
or cloned.

This is required for Microsoft Windows Server 2012 (and later) domain
controllers.

Valid options are:

=over 4

=item B<generate>

Generate a random VM generation ID every time the domain is created or
restored.

=item B<none>

Do not provide a VM generation ID.

=head3 Guest Virtual Time Controls

=over 4

=item B<tsc_mode="MODE">

B<(x86 only)> Specifies how the TSC (Time Stamp Counter) should be provided to
the guest. B<Specifying this option as a number is deprecated.>

Options are:

=over 4

=item B<default>

Guest rdtsc/p is executed natively when monotonicity can be guaranteed
and emulated otherwise (with frequency scaled if necessary).

If a HVM container in B<default> TSC mode is created on a host that
provides constant host TSC, its guest TSC frequency will be the same
as the host. If it is later migrated to another host that provide
constant host TSC and supports Intel VMX TSC scaling/AMD SVM TSC
ratio, its guest TSC frequency will be the same before and after
migration, and guest rdtsc/p will be executed natively after migration as well

=item B<always_emulate>

Guest rdtsc/p is always emulated and the virtual TSC will appear to increment
(kernel and user) at a fixed 1GHz rate, regardless of the pCPU HZ rate or
power state. Although there is an overhead associated with emulation,
this will NOT affect underlying CPU performance.

=item B<native>

Guest rdtsc/p is always executed natively (no monotonicity/frequency
guarantees). Guest rdtsc/p is emulated at native frequency if unsupported
by h/w, else executed natively.

=item B<native_paravirt>

This mode has been removed.

=back

Please see B<xen-tscmode(7)> for more information on this option.

=item B<localtime=BOOLEAN>

Set the real time clock to local time or to UTC. False (0) by default,
i.e. set to UTC.

=item B<rtc_timeoffset=SECONDS>

Set the real time clock offset in seconds. No offset (0) by default.

=item B<vpt_align=BOOLEAN>

Specifies that periodic Virtual Platform Timers should be aligned to
reduce guest interrupts. Enabling this option can reduce power
consumption, especially when a guest uses a high timer interrupt
frequency (HZ) values. The default is true (1).

=item B<timer_mode="MODE">

Specifies the mode for Virtual Timers. The valid values are as follows:

=over 4

=item B<delay_for_missed_ticks>

Delay for missed ticks. Do not advance a vCPU's time beyond the
correct delivery time for interrupts that have been missed due to
preemption. Deliver missed interrupts when the vCPU is rescheduled and
advance the vCPU's virtual time stepwise for each one.

=item B<no_delay_for_missed_ticks>

No delay for missed ticks. As above, missed interrupts are delivered,
but guest time always tracks wallclock (i.e., real) time while doing
so. This is the default.

=item B<no_missed_ticks_pending>

No missed interrupts are held pending. Instead, to ensure ticks are
delivered at some non-zero rate, if we detect missed ticks then the
internal tick alarm is not disabled if the vCPU is preempted during
the next tick period.

=item B<one_missed_tick_pending>

One missed tick pending. Missed interrupts are collapsed
together and delivered as one 'late tick'.  Guest time always tracks
wallclock (i.e., real) time.

=back

=back

=head3 Memory layout

=over 4

=item B<mmio_hole=MBYTES>

Specifies the size the MMIO hole below 4GiB will be.  Only valid for
B<device_model_version="qemu-xen">.

Cannot be smaller than 256. Cannot be larger than 3840.

Known good large value is 3072.

=back

=head3 Support for Paravirtualisation of HVM Guests

The following options allow Paravirtualised features (such as devices)
to be exposed to the guest Operating System in an HVM guest.
Utilising these features requires specific guest support but when
available they will result in improved performance.

=over 4

=item B<xen_platform_pci=BOOLEAN>

Enable or disable the Xen platform PCI device.  The presence of this
virtual device enables a guest Operating System (subject to the
availability of suitable drivers) to make use of paravirtualisation
features such as disk and network devices etc. Enabling these drivers
improves performance and is strongly recommended when available. PV
drivers are available for various Operating Systems including HVM
Linux (out-of-the-box) and Microsoft
Windows L<https://xenproject.org/windows-pv-drivers/>.

Setting B<xen_platform_pci=0> with the default device_model "qemu-xen"
requires at least QEMU 1.6.

=item B<viridian=[ "GROUP", "GROUP", ...]> or B<viridian=BOOLEAN>

The groups of Microsoft Hyper-V (AKA viridian) compatible enlightenments
exposed to the guest. The following groups of enlightenments may be
specified:

=over 4

=item B<base>

This group incorporates the Hypercall MSRs, Virtual processor index MSR,
and APIC access MSRs. These enlightenments can improve performance of
Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 onwards and setting this option
for such guests is strongly recommended.
This group is also a pre-requisite for all others. If it is disabled
then it is an error to attempt to enable any other group.

=item B<freq>

This group incorporates the TSC and APIC frequency MSRs. These
enlightenments can improve performance of Windows 7 and Windows
Server 2008 R2 onwards.

=item B<time_ref_count>

This group incorporates Partition Time Reference Counter MSR. This
enlightenment can improve performance of Windows 8 and Windows
Server 2012 onwards.

=item B<reference_tsc>

This set incorporates the Partition Reference TSC MSR. This
enlightenment can improve performance of Windows 7 and Windows
Server 2008 R2 onwards.

=item B<hcall_remote_tlb_flush>

This set incorporates use of hypercalls for remote TLB flushing.
This enlightenment may improve performance of Windows guests running
on hosts with higher levels of (physical) CPU contention.

=item B<apic_assist>

This set incorporates use of the APIC assist page to avoid EOI of
the local APIC.
This enlightenment may improve performance of guests that make use of
per-vCPU event channel upcall vectors.
Note that this enlightenment will have no effect if the guest is
using APICv posted interrupts.

=item B<crash_ctl>

This group incorporates the crash control MSRs. These enlightenments
allow Windows to write crash information such that it can be logged
by Xen.

=item B<stimer>

This set incorporates the SynIC and synthetic timer MSRs. Windows will
use synthetic timers in preference to emulated HPET for a source of
ticks and hence enabling this group will ensure that ticks will be
consistent with use of an enlightened time source (B<time_ref_count> or
B<reference_tsc>).

=item B<hcall_ipi>

This set incorporates use of a hypercall for interprocessor interrupts.
This enlightenment may improve performance of Windows guests with multiple
virtual CPUs.

=item B<defaults>

This is a special value that enables the default set of groups, which
is currently the B<base>, B<freq>, B<time_ref_count>, B<apic_assist>,
B<crash_ctl> and B<stimer> groups.

=item B<all>

This is a special value that enables all available groups.

=back

Groups can be disabled by prefixing the name with '!'. So, for example,
to enable all groups except B<freq>, specify:

=over 4

B<viridian=[ "all", "!freq" ]>

=back

For details of the enlightenments see the latest version of Microsoft's
Hypervisor Top-Level Functional Specification.

The enlightenments should be harmless for other versions of Windows
(although they will not give any benefit) and the majority of other
non-Windows OSes.
However it is known that they are incompatible with some other Operating
Systems and in some circumstance can prevent Xen's own paravirtualisation
interfaces for HVM guests from being used.

The viridian option can be specified as a boolean. A value of true (1)
is equivalent to the list [ "defaults" ], and a value of false (0) is
equivalent to an empty list.

=back

=head3 Emulated VGA Graphics Device

The following options control the features of the emulated graphics
device.  Many of these options behave similarly to the equivalent key
in the B<VFB_SPEC_STRING> for configuring virtual frame buffer devices
(see above).

=over 4

=item B<videoram=MBYTES>

Sets the amount of RAM which the emulated video card will contain,
which in turn limits the resolutions and bit depths which will be
available.

When using the qemu-xen-traditional device-model, the default as well as
minimum amount of video RAM for stdvga is 8 MB, which is sufficient for e.g.
1600x1200 at 32bpp. For the upstream qemu-xen device-model, the default and
minimum is 16 MB.

When using the emulated Cirrus graphics card (B<vga="cirrus">) and the
qemu-xen-traditional device-model, the amount of video RAM is fixed at 4 MB,
which is sufficient for 1024x768 at 32 bpp. For the upstream qemu-xen
device-model, the default and minimum is 8 MB.

For QXL vga, both the default and minimal are 128MB.
If B<videoram> is set less than 128MB, an error will be triggered.

=item B<stdvga=BOOLEAN>

Speficies a standard VGA card with VBE (VESA BIOS Extensions) as the
emulated graphics device. If your guest supports VBE 2.0 or
later (e.g. Windows XP onwards) then you should enable this.
stdvga supports more video ram and bigger resolutions than Cirrus.
The default is false (0) which means to emulate
a Cirrus Logic GD5446 VGA card.
B<This option is deprecated, use vga="stdvga" instead>.

=item B<vga="STRING">

Selects the emulated video card.
Options are: B<none>, B<stdvga>, B<cirrus> and B<qxl>.
The default is B<cirrus>.

In general, QXL should work with the Spice remote display protocol
for acceleration, and a QXL driver is necessary in the guest in that case.
QXL can also work with the VNC protocol, but it will be like a standard
VGA card without acceleration.

=item B<vnc=BOOLEAN>

Allow access to the display via the VNC protocol.  This enables the
other VNC-related settings.  The default is (1) enabled.

=item B<vnclisten="ADDRESS[:DISPLAYNUM]">

Specifies the IP address and, optionally, the VNC display number to use.

=item B<vncdisplay=DISPLAYNUM>

Specifies the VNC display number to use. The actual TCP port number
will be DISPLAYNUM+5900.

=item B<vncunused=BOOLEAN>

Requests that the VNC display setup searches for a free TCP port to use.
The actual display used can be accessed with B<xl vncviewer>.

=item B<vncpasswd="PASSWORD">

Specifies the password for the VNC server. If the password is set to an
empty string, authentication on the VNC server will be disabled
allowing any user to connect.

=item B<keymap="LANG">

Configure the keymap to use for the keyboard associated with this
display. If the input method does not easily support raw keycodes
(e.g. this is often the case when using VNC) then this allows us to
correctly map the input keys into keycodes seen by the guest. The
specific values which are accepted are defined by the version of the
device-model which you are using. See B<Keymaps> below or consult the
B<qemu(1)> manpage. The default is B<en-us>.

=item B<sdl=BOOLEAN>

Specifies that the display should be presented via an X window (using
Simple DirectMedia Layer). The default is (0) not enabled.

=item B<opengl=BOOLEAN>

Enable OpenGL acceleration of the SDL display. Only effects machines
using B<device_model_version="qemu-xen-traditional"> and only if the
device-model was compiled with OpenGL support. Default is (0) false.

=item B<nographic=BOOLEAN>

Enable or disable the virtual graphics device.  The default is to
provide a VGA graphics device but this option can be used to disable
it.

=back

=head3 Spice Graphics Support

The following options control the features of SPICE.

=over 4

=item B<spice=BOOLEAN>

Allow access to the display via the SPICE protocol.  This enables the
other SPICE-related settings.

=item B<spicehost="ADDRESS">

Specifies the interface address to listen on if given, otherwise any
interface.

=item B<spiceport=NUMBER>

Specifies the port to listen on by the SPICE server if SPICE is
enabled.

=item B<spicetls_port=NUMBER>

Specifies the secure port to listen on by the SPICE server if SPICE
is enabled. At least one of B<spiceport> or B<spicetls_port> must be
given if SPICE is enabled.

B<Note:> the options depending on B<spicetls_port>
have not been supported.

=item B<spicedisable_ticketing=BOOLEAN>

Enable clients to connect without specifying a password. When disabled,
B<spicepasswd> must be set. The default is (0) false.

=item B<spicepasswd="PASSWORD">

Specify the password which is used by clients for establishing a connection.

=item B<spiceagent_mouse=BOOLEAN>

Whether SPICE agent is used for client mouse mode. The default is (1) true.

=item B<spicevdagent=BOOLEAN>

Enables the SPICE vdagent. The SPICE vdagent is an optional component for
enhancing user experience and performing guest-oriented management
tasks. Its features include: client mouse mode (no need to grab the mouse
by the client, no mouse lag), automatic adjustment of screen resolution,
copy and paste (text and image) between the client and the guest. It also
requires the vdagent service installed on the guest OS to work.
The default is (0) disabled.

=item B<spice_clipboard_sharing=BOOLEAN>

Enables SPICE clipboard sharing (copy/paste). It requires that
B<spicevdagent> is enabled. The default is (0) false.

=item B<spiceusbredirection=NUMBER>

Enables SPICE USB redirection. Creates a NUMBER of USB redirection channels
for redirecting up to 4 USB devices from the SPICE client to the guest's QEMU.
It requires an USB controller and, if not defined, it will automatically add
an USB2.0 controller. The default is (0) disabled.

=item B<spice_image_compression="COMPRESSION">

Specifies what image compression is to be used by SPICE (if given), otherwise
the QEMU default will be used. Please see the documentation of your QEMU
version for more details.

Available options are: B<auto_glz, auto_lz, quic, glz, lz, off>.

=item B<spice_streaming_video="VIDEO">

Specifies what streaming video setting is to be used by SPICE (if given),
otherwise the QEMU default will be used.

Available options are: B<filter, all, off>.

=back

=head3 Miscellaneous Emulated Hardware

=over 4

=item B<serial=[ "DEVICE", "DEVICE", ...]>

Redirect virtual serial ports to B<DEVICE>s. Please see the
B<-serial> option in the B<qemu(1)> manpage for details of the valid
B<DEVICE> options. Default is B<vc> when in graphical mode and
B<stdio> if B<nographic=1> is used.

The form serial=DEVICE is also accepted for backwards compatibility.

=item B<soundhw="DEVICE">

Select the virtual sound card to expose to the guest. The valid
devices are defined by the device model configuration, please see the
B<qemu(1)> manpage for details. The default is not to export any sound
device.

=item B<vkb_device=BOOLEAN>

Specifies that the HVM guest gets a vkdb. The default is true (1).

=item B<usb=BOOLEAN>

Enables or disables an emulated USB bus in the guest.

=item B<usbversion=NUMBER>

Specifies the type of an emulated USB bus in the guest, values 1 for USB1.1,
2 for USB2.0 and 3 for USB3.0. It is available only with an upstream QEMU.
Due to implementation limitations this is not compatible with the B<usb>
and B<usbdevice> parameters.
Default is (0) no USB controller defined.

=item B<usbdevice=[ "DEVICE", "DEVICE", ...]>

Adds B<DEVICE>s to the emulated USB bus. The USB bus must also be
enabled using B<usb=1>. The most common use for this option is
B<usbdevice=['tablet']> which adds a pointer device using absolute
coordinates. Such devices function better than relative coordinate
devices (such as a standard mouse) since many methods of exporting
guest graphics (such as VNC) work better in this mode. Note that this
is independent of the actual pointer device you are using on the
host/client side.

Host devices can also be passed through in this way, by specifying
host:USBID, where USBID is of the form xxxx:yyyy.  The USBID can
typically be found by using B<lsusb(1)> or B<usb-devices(1)>.

If you wish to use the "host:bus.addr" format, remove any leading '0' from the
bus and addr. For example, for the USB device on bus 008 dev 002, you should
write "host:8.2".

The form usbdevice=DEVICE is also accepted for backwards compatibility.

More valid options can be found in the "usbdevice" section of the QEMU
documentation.

=item B<vendor_device="VENDOR_DEVICE">

Selects which variant of the QEMU xen-pvdevice should be used for this
guest. Valid values are:

=over 4

=item B<none>

The xen-pvdevice should be omitted. This is the default.

=item B<xenserver>

The xenserver variant of the xen-pvdevice (device-id=C000) will be
specified, enabling the use of XenServer PV drivers in the guest.

=back

=head2 PVH Guest Specific Options

=over 4

=item B<nestedhvm=BOOLEAN>

Enable or disables guest access to hardware virtualisation features,
e.g. it allows a guest Operating System to also function as a hypervisor.
You may want this option if you want to run another hypervisor (including
another copy of Xen) within a Xen guest or to support a guest Operating
System which uses hardware virtualisation extensions (e.g. Windows XP
compatibility mode on more modern Windows OS).

This option is disabled by default.

=item B<bootloader="PROGRAM">

Run C<PROGRAM> to find the kernel image and ramdisk to use.  Normally
C<PROGRAM> would be C<pygrub>, which is an emulation of
grub/grub2/syslinux. Either B<kernel> or B<bootloader> must be specified
for PV guests.

=item B<bootloader_args=[ "ARG", "ARG", ...]>

Append B<ARG>s to the arguments to the B<bootloader>
program. Alternatively if the argument is a simple string then it will
be split into words at whitespace B<(this second option is deprecated)>.

=item B<timer_mode="MODE">

Specifies the mode for Virtual Timers. The valid values are as follows:

=over 4

=item B<delay_for_missed_ticks>

Delay for missed ticks. Do not advance a vCPU's time beyond the
correct delivery time for interrupts that have been missed due to
preemption. Deliver missed interrupts when the vCPU is rescheduled and
advance the vCPU's virtual time stepwise for each one.

=item B<no_delay_for_missed_ticks>

No delay for missed ticks. As above, missed interrupts are delivered,
but guest time always tracks wallclock (i.e., real) time while doing
so. This is the default.

=item B<no_missed_ticks_pending>

No missed interrupts are held pending. Instead, to ensure ticks are
delivered at some non-zero rate, if we detect missed ticks then the
internal tick alarm is not disabled if the vCPU is preempted during
the next tick period.

=item B<one_missed_tick_pending>

=head3 Paging

The following options control the mechanisms used to virtualise guest
memory.  The defaults are selected to give the best results for the
common cases so you should normally leave these options
unspecified.

=over 4

=item B<hap=BOOLEAN>

Turns "hardware assisted paging" (the use of the hardware nested page
table feature) on or off.  This feature is called EPT (Extended Page
Tables) by Intel and NPT (Nested Page Tables) or RVI (Rapid
Virtualisation Indexing) by AMD. If turned
off, Xen will run the guest in "shadow page table" mode where the
guest's page table updates and/or TLB flushes etc. will be emulated.
Use of HAP is the default when available.

=item B<oos=BOOLEAN>

Turns "out of sync pagetables" on or off.  When running in shadow page
table mode, the guest's page table updates may be deferred as
specified in the Intel/AMD architecture manuals.  However, this may
expose unexpected bugs in the guest, or find bugs in Xen, so it is
possible to disable this feature.  Use of out of sync page tables,
when Xen thinks it appropriate, is the default.

=item B<shadow_memory=MBYTES>

Number of megabytes to set aside for shadowing guest pagetable pages
(effectively acting as a cache of translated pages) or to use for HAP
state. By default this is 1MB per guest vCPU plus 8KB per MB of guest
RAM. You should not normally need to adjust this value. However, if you
are not using hardware assisted paging (i.e. you are using shadow
mode) and your guest workload consists of a very large number of
similar processes then increasing this value may improve performance.

=head2 Device-Model Options

The following options control the selection of the device-model.  This
is the component which provides emulation of the virtual devices to an
HVM guest.  For a PV guest a device-model is sometimes used to provide
backends for certain PV devices (most usually a virtual framebuffer
device).

=over 4

=item B<device_model_version="DEVICE-MODEL">

Selects which variant of the device-model should be used for this
guest.

Valid values are:

=over 4

=item B<qemu-xen>

Use the device-model merged into the upstream QEMU project.
This device-model is the default for Linux dom0.

=item B<qemu-xen-traditional>

Use the device-model based upon the historical Xen fork of QEMU.
This device-model is still the default for NetBSD dom0.

=back

It is recommended to accept the default value for new guests.  If
you have existing guests then, depending on the nature of the guest
Operating System, you may wish to force them to use the device
model which they were installed with.

=item B<device_model_override="PATH">

Override the path to the binary to be used as the device-model. The
binary provided here MUST be consistent with the
B<device_model_version> which you have specified. You should not
normally need to specify this option.

=item B<device_model_stubdomain_override=BOOLEAN>

Override the use of stubdomain based device-model.  Normally this will
be automatically selected based upon the other features and options
you have selected.

=item B<device_model_stubdomain_seclabel="LABEL">

Assign an XSM security label to the device-model stubdomain.

=item B<device_model_args=[ "ARG", "ARG", ...]>

Pass additional arbitrary options on the device-model command
line. Each element in the list is passed as an option to the
device-model.

=item B<device_model_args_pv=[ "ARG", "ARG", ...]>

Pass additional arbitrary options on the device-model command line for
a PV device model only. Each element in the list is passed as an
option to the device-model.

=item B<device_model_args_hvm=[ "ARG", "ARG", ...]>

Pass additional arbitrary options on the device-model command line for
an HVM device model only. Each element in the list is passed as an
option to the device-model.

=back

=head2 Keymaps

The keymaps available are defined by the device-model which you are
using. Commonly this includes:

        ar  de-ch  es  fo     fr-ca  hu  ja  mk     no  pt-br  sv
        da  en-gb  et  fr     fr-ch  is  lt  nl     pl  ru     th
        de  en-us  fi  fr-be  hr     it  lv  nl-be  pt  sl     tr

The default is B<en-us>.

See B<qemu(1)> for more information.

=head2 Architecture Specific options

=head3 ARM

=over 4

=item B<gic_version="vN">

Version of the GIC emulated for the guest.

Currently, the following versions are supported:

=over 4

=item B<v2>

Emulate a GICv2

=item B<v3>

Emulate a GICv3. Note that the emulated GIC does not support the
GICv2 compatibility mode.

=item B<default>

Emulate the same version as the native GIC hardware used by the host where
the domain was created.

=back

This requires hardware compatibility with the requested version, either
natively or via hardware backwards compatibility support.

=item B<vuart="uart">

To enable vuart console, user must specify the following option in the
VM config file:

vuart = "sbsa_uart"

Currently, only the "sbsa_uart" model is supported for ARM.

=back

=head3 x86

=over 4

=item B<mca_caps=[ "CAP", "CAP", ... ]>

(HVM only) Enable MCA capabilities besides default ones enabled
by Xen hypervisor for the HVM domain. "CAP" can be one in the
following list:

=over 4

=item B<"lmce">

Intel local MCE

=item B<default>

No MCA capabilities in above list are enabled.
