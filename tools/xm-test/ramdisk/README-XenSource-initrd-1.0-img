XenSource xm-test 1.0 initrds
=============================

http://xm-test.xensource.com/ramdisks/initrd-1.0-i386.img and
http://xm-test.xensource.com/ramdisks/initrd-1.0-powerpc.img are initrds
suitable for use with Xen's xm-test regression testing suite.  They has been
built and provided by XenSource, for the convenience of Xen users.  xm-test
initrds may be mixed across minor xm-test versions, but not across major
versions; this initrd is suitable for all 1.0.x versions of xm-test (as
shipped with the Xen unstable tree for a short while between Xen 3.0.3 and
Xen 3.0.4).

In order to use one of these initrds, run "./autogen; ./configure; make
existing" inside the xm-test directory, and the appropriate initrd for your
architecture will be downloaded automatically.  Alternatively, if you have
already downloaded that file, place it into the xm-test/ramdisk directory and
run the same command.  In either case, runtest.sh can then be used as normal.
See xm-test/README for more details.

These initrds were built using the infrastructure provided by xm-test.  Each
is a full guest operating system and filesystem, and as such includes a large
number of pieces of software.  The source code for the majority of these are
included in full inside the file
http://xm-test.xensource.com/ramdisks/<INITRD>-buildroot.tar.bz2, where
<INITRD> is either initrd-1.0-i386 or initrd-1.0-powerpc as appropriate, or
alongside this file.  Copyright statements and licences are contained therein.
The remaining source code is included in the Xen distribution, at
http://www.xensource.com/xen/downloads/archives.html.  The configurations used
for BusyBox, uClibc, and Buildroot are available as
http://xm-test.xensource.com/ramdisks/<INITRD>-busybox-config,
http://xm-test.xensource.com/ramdisks/<INITRD>-uClibc-config, and
http://xm-test.xensource.com/ramdisks/<INITRD>-buildroot-config respectively,
or alongside this file.

XenSource and the Xen contributors are grateful to the authors of these
software packages for their contributions to free and open-source software.
