INSTALLING A SECURITY POLICY IN XEN
===================================

By default, the access control architecture is disabled in Xen. To
enable the access control architecture in Xen follow the steps below.
This description assumes that you want to install the Chinese Wall and
Simple Type Enforcement policy. Some file names need to be replaced
below to activate the Chinese Wall OR the Type Enforcement policy
exclusively (chwall_ste --> {chwall, ste}).

1. enable access control in Xen
       # cd "xen_root"
       # edit/xemacs/vi Config.mk

       change the lines:
       ACM_SECURITY ?= n
       ACM_DEFAULT_SECURITY_POLICY ?= ACM_NULL_POLICY

       to:
       ACM_SECURITY ?= y
       ACM_DEFAULT_SECURITY_POLICY ?= ACM_CHINESE_WALL_AND_SIMPLE_TYPE_ENFORCEMENT_POLICY

       # make all
       # ./install.sh

2. compile the policy from xml to a binary format that can be loaded
   into the hypervisor for enforcement
       # cd tools/security
       # make

       manual steps (alternative to make boot_install):
       #./secpol_xml2bin chwall_ste
       #cp policies/chwall_ste/chwall_ste.bin /boot
       #edit /boot/grub/grub.conf
        add the follwoing line to your xen boot entry:
       "module chwall_ste.bin"

       alternatively, you can try our automatic translation and
       installation of the policy:
       # make boot_install

       [we try hard to do the right thing to the right boot entry but
        please verify boot entry in /boot/grub/grub.conf afterwards;
        your xen boot entry should have an additional module line
        specifying a chwall_ste.bin file with the correct directory
        (e.g. "/" or "/boot").]


3. reboot into the newly compiled hypervisor

        after boot
	#xm dmesg should show an entry about the policy being loaded
            during the boot process

        #tools/security/secpol_tool getpolicy
            should print the new chwall_ste binary policy representation
