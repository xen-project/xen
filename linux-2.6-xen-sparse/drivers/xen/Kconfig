          to other virtual machines.

config XEN_PCIDEV_BACKEND
	tristate "PCI device backend driver"
	depends on PCI && XEN_BACKEND
	default XEN_PRIVILEGED_GUEST
	help
	  The PCI device backend driver allows the kernel to export arbitrary
	  PCI devices to other guests. If you select this to be a module, you
	  will need to make sure no other driver has bound to the device(s)
	  you want to make visible to other guests.

config XEN_PCIDEV_BACKEND_VPCI
	bool "Virtual PCI"
	---help---
	  This PCI Backend hides the true PCI topology and makes the frontend
	  think there is a single PCI bus with only the exported devices on it.
	  For example, a device at 03:05.0 will be re-assigned to 00:00.0. A
	  second device at 02:1a.0 will be re-assigned to 00:01.0.

config XEN_PCIDEV_BACKEND_PASS
	bool "Passthrough"
	---help---
	  This PCI Backend provides a real view of the PCI topology to the
	  frontend (for example, a device at 06:01.b will still appear at
	  06:01.b to the frontend). This is similar to how Xen 2.0.x exposed
	  PCI devices to its driver domains. This may be required for drivers
	  which depend on finding their hardward in certain bus/slot
	  locations.

config XEN_BLKDEV_BACKEND
	tristate "Block-device backend driver"
        depends on XEN_BACKEND
	default y
	help
	  The block-device backend driver allows the kernel to export its
	  block devices to other guests via a high-performance shared-memory
	  interface.

config XEN_BLKDEV_TAP_BE
        tristate "Block Tap support for backend driver (DANGEROUS)"
        depends on XEN_BLKDEV_BACKEND
        default n
        help
          If you intend to use the block tap driver, the backend domain will
          not know the domain id of the real frontend, and so will not be able
          to map its data pages.  This modifies the backend to attempt to map
          from both the tap domain and the real frontend.  This presents a
          security risk, and so should ONLY be used for development
          with the blktap.  This option will be removed as the block drivers are
          modified to use grant tables.

config XEN_NETDEV_BACKEND
	tristate "Network-device backend driver"
        depends on XEN_BACKEND
	default y
	help
	  The network-device backend driver allows the kernel to export its
	  network devices to other guests via a high-performance shared-memory
	  interface.

config XEN_NETDEV_PIPELINED_TRANSMITTER
	bool "Pipelined transmitter (DANGEROUS)"
	depends on XEN_NETDEV_BACKEND
	default n
	help
	  If the net backend is a dumb domain, such as a transparent Ethernet
	  bridge with no local IP interface, it is safe to say Y here to get
	  slightly lower network overhead.
	  If the backend has a local IP interface; or may be doing smart things
	  like reassembling packets to perform firewall filtering; or if you
	  are unsure; or if you experience network hangs when this option is
	  enabled; then you must say N here.

config XEN_NETDEV_LOOPBACK
	tristate "Network-device loopback driver"
	depends on XEN_NETDEV_BACKEND
	default y
	help
	  A two-interface loopback device to emulate a local netfront-netback
	  connection.

config XEN_TPMDEV_BACKEND
	tristate "TPM-device backend driver"
        depends on XEN_BACKEND
	default n
	help
	  The TPM-device backend driver

config XEN_TPMDEV_CLOSE_IF_VTPM_FAILS
	bool "TPM backend closes upon vTPM failure"
	depends on XEN_TPMDEV_BACKEND
	default n
	help
	  The TPM backend closes the channel if the vTPM in userspace indicates
	  a failure. The corresponding domain's channel will be closed.
	  Say Y if you want this feature.

config XEN_BLKDEV_FRONTEND
	tristate "Block-device frontend driver"
	depends on XEN
	default y
	help
	  The block-device frontend driver allows the kernel to access block
	  devices mounted within another guest OS. Unless you are building a
	  dedicated device-driver domain, or your master control domain
	  (domain 0), then you almost certainly want to say Y here.

config XEN_NETDEV_FRONTEND
	tristate "Network-device frontend driver"
	depends on XEN
	default y
	help
	  The network-device frontend driver allows the kernel to access
	  network interfaces within another guest OS. Unless you are building a
	  dedicated device-driver domain, or your master control domain
	  (domain 0), then you almost certainly want to say Y here.

config XEN_BLKDEV_TAP
	tristate "Block device tap driver"
        depends on XEN_BACKEND
	default n
	help
	  This driver allows a VM to interact on block device channels
	  to other VMs.  Block messages may be passed through or redirected
	  to a character device, allowing device prototyping in application
	  space.  Odds are that you want to say N here.

config XEN_TPMDEV_FRONTEND
	tristate "TPM-device frontend driver"
	default n
	select TCG_TPM
	select TCG_XEN
	help
	  The TPM-device frontend driver.

config XEN_SCRUB_PAGES
	bool "Scrub memory before freeing it to Xen"
	default y
	help
	  Erase memory contents before freeing it back to Xen's global
	  pool. This ensures that any secrets contained within that
	  memory (e.g., private keys) cannot be found by other guests that
	  may be running on the machine. Most people will want to say Y here.
	  If security is not a concern then you may increase performance by
	  saying N.

config XEN_DISABLE_SERIAL
	bool "Disable serial port drivers"
	default y
	help
	  Disable serial port drivers, allowing the Xen console driver
	  to provide a serial console at ttyS0.

config XEN_SYSFS
	tristate "Export Xen attributes in sysfs"
	depends on SYSFS
	default y
	help
		Xen hypervisor attributes will show up under /sys/hypervisor/.
