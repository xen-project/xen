config M386
	bool "386"
	---help---
	  This is the processor type of your CPU. This information is used for
	  optimizing purposes. In order to compile a kernel that can run on
	  all x86 CPU types (albeit not optimally fast), you can specify
	  "386" here.

	  The kernel will not necessarily run on earlier architectures than
	  the one you have chosen, e.g. a Pentium optimized kernel will run on
	  a PPro, but not necessarily on a i486.

	  Here are the settings recommended for greatest speed:
	  - "386" for the AMD/Cyrix/Intel 386DX/DXL/SL/SLC/SX, Cyrix/TI
	  486DLC/DLC2, UMC 486SX-S and NexGen Nx586.  Only "386" kernels
	  will run on a 386 class machine.
	  - "486" for the AMD/Cyrix/IBM/Intel 486DX/DX2/DX4 or
	  SL/SLC/SLC2/SLC3/SX/SX2 and UMC U5D or U5S.
	  - "586" for generic Pentium CPUs lacking the TSC
	  (time stamp counter) register.
	  - "Pentium-Classic" for the Intel Pentium.
	  - "Pentium-MMX" for the Intel Pentium MMX.
	  - "Pentium-Pro" for the Intel Pentium Pro.
	  - "Pentium-II" for the Intel Pentium II or pre-Coppermine Celeron.
	  - "Pentium-III" for the Intel Pentium III or Coppermine Celeron.
	  - "Pentium-4" for the Intel Pentium 4 or P4-based Celeron.
	  - "K6" for the AMD K6, K6-II and K6-III (aka K6-3D).
	  - "Athlon" for the AMD K7 family (Athlon/Duron/Thunderbird).
	  - "Crusoe" for the Transmeta Crusoe series.
	  - "Efficeon" for the Transmeta Efficeon series.
	  - "Winchip-C6" for original IDT Winchip.
	  - "Winchip-2" for IDT Winchip 2.
	  - "Winchip-2A" for IDT Winchips with 3dNow! capabilities.
	  - "GeodeGX1" for Geode GX1 (Cyrix MediaGX).
	  - "CyrixIII/VIA C3" for VIA Cyrix III or VIA C3.
	  - "VIA C3-2 for VIA C3-2 "Nehemiah" (model 9 and above).

	  If you don't know what to do, choose "386".

config M486
	bool "486"
	help
	  Select this for a 486 series processor, either Intel or one of the
	  compatible processors from AMD, Cyrix, IBM, or Intel.  Includes DX,

	  Select this for a Pentium with the MMX graphics/multimedia
	  extended instructions.

config M686
	bool "Pentium-Pro"
	help
	  Select this for Intel Pentium Pro chips.  This enables the use of
	  Pentium Pro extended instructions, and disables the init-time guard
	  against the f00f bug found in earlier Pentiums.

config MPENTIUMII
	bool "Pentium-II/Celeron(pre-Coppermine)"
	help
	  Select this for Intel chips based on the Pentium-II and
	  pre-Coppermine Celeron core.  This option enables an unaligned
	  copy optimization, compiles the kernel with optimization flags
	  tailored for the chip, and applies any applicable Pentium Pro
	  optimizations.

config MPENTIUMIII
	bool "Pentium-III/Celeron(Coppermine)/Pentium-III Xeon"
	help
	  Select this for Intel chips based on the Pentium-III and
	  Celeron-Coppermine core.  This option enables use of some
	  extended prefetch instructions in addition to the Pentium II
	  extensions.

config MPENTIUMM
	bool "Pentium M"

	  Select this for Intel Pentium M (not Pentium-4 M)
	  notebook chips.

config MPENTIUM4
	bool "Pentium-4/Celeron(P4-based)/Pentium-4 M/Xeon"
	help
	  Select this for Intel Pentium 4 chips.  This includes the
	  Pentium 4, P4-based Celeron and Xeon, and Pentium-4 M
	  (not Pentium M) chips.  This option enables compile flags
	  optimized for the chip, uses the correct cache shift, and
	  applies any applicable Pentium III optimizations.

config MK6
	bool "K6/K6-II/K6-III"
	help
	  Select this for an AMD K6-family processor.  Enables use of
	  some extended instructions, and passes appropriate optimization
	  flags to GCC.

config MK7
	bool "Athlon/Duron/K7"
	help
	  Select this for an AMD Athlon K7-family processor.  Enables use of
	  some extended instructions, and passes appropriate optimization
	  flags to GCC.

config MK8
	bool "Opteron/Athlon64/Hammer/K8"

	  Select this for an AMD Opteron or Athlon64 Hammer-family processor.  Enables
	  use of some extended instructions, and passes appropriate optimization
	  flags to GCC.

config MCRUSOE
	bool "Crusoe"
	help
	  Select this for a Transmeta Crusoe processor.  Treats the processor
	  like a 586 with TSC, and sets some GCC optimization flags (like a
	  Pentium Pro with no alignment requirements).

config MEFFICEON
	bool "Efficeon"
	help
	  Select this for a Transmeta Efficeon processor.

config MWINCHIPC6
	bool "Winchip-C6"
	help
	  Select this for an IDT Winchip C6 chip.  Linux and GCC
	  treat this chip as a 586TSC with some extended instructions
	  and alignment requirements.

config MWINCHIP2
	bool "Winchip-2"
	help
	  Select this for an IDT Winchip-2.  Linux and GCC
	  treat this chip as a 586TSC with some extended instructions
	  and alignment requirements.

config MWINCHIP3D
	bool "Winchip-2A/Winchip-3"
	help
	  Select this for an IDT Winchip-2A or 3.  Linux and GCC
	  treat this chip as a 586TSC with some extended instructions
	  and alignment reqirements.  Also enable out of order memory
	  stores for this CPU, which can increase performance of some
	  operations.

config MGEODEGX1
	bool "GeodeGX1"
	help
	  Select this for a Geode GX1 (Cyrix MediaGX) chip.

config MCYRIXIII
	bool "CyrixIII/VIA-C3"
	help
	  Select this for a Cyrix III or C3 chip.  Presently Linux and GCC
	  treat this chip as a generic 586. Whilst the CPU is 686 class,
	  it lacks the cmov extension which gcc assumes is present when
	  generating 686 code.
	  Note that Nehemiah (Model 9) and above will not boot with this
	  kernel due to them lacking the 3DNow! instructions used in earlier
	  incarnations of the CPU.

config MVIAC3_2
	bool "VIA C3-2 (Nehemiah)"
	help
	  Select this for a VIA C3 "Nehemiah". Selecting this enables usage
	  of SSE and tells gcc to treat the CPU as a 686.
	  Note, this kernel will not boot on older (pre model 9) C3s.

	---help---
	  This enables support for systems with more than one CPU. If you have

	  If you say N here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor
	  machines, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor machine. If
	  you say Y here, the kernel will run on many, but not all,
	  singleprocessor machines. On a singleprocessor machine, the kernel
	  will run faster if you say N here.

	  Note that if you say Y here and choose architecture "586" or
	  "Pentium" under "Processor family", the kernel will not work on 486
	  architectures. Similarly, multiprocessor kernels for the "PPro"
	  architecture may not work on all Pentium based boards.

	  People using multiprocessor machines who say Y here should also say
	  Y to "Enhanced Real Time Clock Support", below. The "Advanced Power
	  Management" code will be disabled if you say Y here.

	  Linux can use up to 64 Gigabytes of physical memory on x86 systems.
	  However, the address space of 32-bit x86 processors is only 4
	  Gigabytes large. That means that, if you have a large amount of
	  physical memory, not all of it can be "permanently mapped" by the
	  kernel. The physical memory that's not permanently mapped is called
	  "high memory".

	  If you are compiling a kernel which will never run on a machine with
	  more than 1 Gigabyte total physical RAM, answer "off" here (default
	  choice and suitable for most users). This will result in a "3GB/1GB"
	  split: 3GB are mapped so that each process sees a 3GB virtual memory
	  space and the remaining part of the 4GB virtual memory space is used
	  by the kernel to permanently map as much physical memory as
	  possible.

	  If the machine has between 1 and 4 Gigabytes physical RAM, then
	  answer "4GB" here.

	  If more than 4 Gigabytes is used then answer "64GB" here. This

#	   processor access to memory ranges. This is most useful if you have
#	   a video (VGA) card on a PCI or AGP bus. Enabling write-combining

#
#	   The Cyrix 6x86, 6x86MX and M II processors have Address Range

	  On PCI systems, the BIOS can be used to detect the PCI devices and

	  have BIOS bugs and may crash if this is done. Also, some embedded
	  PCI-based systems don't have any BIOS at all. Linux can also try to
	  detect the PCI hardware directly without using the BIOS.

	  With this option, you can specify how Linux should detect the
	  PCI devices. If you choose "BIOS", the BIOS will be used,
	  if you choose "Direct", the BIOS won't be used, and if you
	  choose "MMConfig", then PCI Express MMCONFIG will be used.
	  If you choose "Any", the kernel will try MMCONFIG, then the
	  direct access method and falls back to the BIOS if that doesn't
	  work. If unsure, go with the default, which is "Any".
