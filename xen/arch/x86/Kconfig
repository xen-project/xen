       default y
       ---help---
         Linear pagetables (also called "recursive pagetables") refers
         to the practice of a guest operating system having pagetable
         entries pointing to other pagetables of the same level (i.e.,
         allowing L2 PTEs to point to other L2 pages).  Some operating
         systems use it as a simple way to consistently map the current
         process's pagetables into its own virtual address space.

         Linux and MiniOS don't use this technique.  NetBSD and Novell
         Netware do; there may be other custom operating systems which
         do.  If you're certain you don't plan on having PV guests
         which use this feature, turning it off can reduce the attack
         surface.

config SHADOW_PAGING
        bool "Shadow Paging"
        default y
        ---help---

          Shadow paging is a software alternative to hardware paging support
          (Intel EPT, AMD NPT).

          It is required for:
            * Running HVM guests on hardware lacking hardware paging support
              (First-generation Intel VT-x or AMD SVM).
            * Live migration of PV guests.

          Under a small number of specific workloads, shadow paging may be
          deliberately used as a performance optimisation.

          If unsure, say Y.

config BIGMEM
	bool "big memory support"
	default n
	---help---
	  Allows Xen to support up to 123Tb of memory.

	  This requires enlarging struct page_info as well as shrinking
	  the always accessible direct mapped memory range.

	  If unsure, say N.

config HVM_FEP
	bool "HVM Forced Emulation Prefix support" if EXPERT = "y"
	default DEBUG
	---help---

	  Compiles in a feature that allows HVM guest to arbitrarily
	  exercise the instruction emulator.

	  This feature can only be enabled during boot time with
	  appropriate hypervisor command line option. Please read
	  hypervisor command line documentation before trying to use
	  this feature.

	  This is strictly for testing purposes, and not appropriate
	  for use in production.

	  If unsure, say N.

config TBOOT
	def_bool y
	prompt "Xen tboot support" if EXPERT = "y"
	depends on X86
	select CRYPTO
	---help---
	  Allows support for Trusted Boot using the Intel(R) Trusted Execution
	  Technology (TXT)

	  If unsure, say Y.

config XEN_GUEST
	def_bool n
	prompt "Xen Guest"
	---help---
	  Support for Xen detecting when it is running under Xen.

	  If unsure, say N.

config PVH_GUEST
	def_bool n
	prompt "PVH Guest"
	depends on XEN_GUEST
	---help---
	  Support booting using the PVH ABI.

	  If unsure, say N.

config PV_SHIM
	def_bool n
	prompt "PV Shim"
	depends on PV && XEN_GUEST
	---help---
	  Build Xen with a mode which acts as a shim to allow PV guest to run
	  in an HVM/PVH container. This mode can only be enabled with command
	  line option.

	  If unsure, say N.

config PV_SHIM_EXCLUSIVE
	def_bool n
	prompt "PV Shim Exclusive"
	depends on PV_SHIM
	---help---
	  Build Xen in a way which unconditionally assumes PV_SHIM mode.  This
	  option is only intended for use when building a dedicated PV Shim
	  firmware, and will not function correctly in other scenarios.

	  If unsure, say N.
