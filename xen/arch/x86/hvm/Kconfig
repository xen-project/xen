	  Interfaces to support HVM domains.  HVM domains require hardware
	  virtualisation extensions (e.g. Intel VT-x, AMD SVM), but can boot
	  guests which have no specific Xen knowledge.

	  This option is needed if you want to run HVM or PVH domains.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config AMD_SVM

	help
	  Enables virtual machine extensions on platforms that implement the
	  AMD Virtualization Technology (AMD-V).
	  If your system includes a processor with AMD-V support, say Y.
	  If in doubt, say Y.

	default DEBUG
	help
	  Compiles in a feature that allows HVM guest to arbitrarily
	  exercise the instruction emulator.

	  This feature can only be enabled during boot time with
	  appropriate hypervisor command line option. Please read
	  hypervisor command line documentation before trying to use
	  this feature.

	  This is strictly for testing purposes, and not appropriate
	  for use in production.

	  If unsure, say N.

config ALTP2M

	default y
	help
	  Alternate-p2m allows a guest to manage multiple p2m guest physical
	  "memory views" (as opposed to a single p2m).
	  Useful for memory introspection.

	  If unsure, stay with defaults.

config VIRIDIAN
	bool "Hyper-V enlightenments for guests" if EXPERT
	default y
	help
	  Support optimizations for Hyper-V guests such as hypercalls, efficient
	  timers and interrupt handling. This is to improve performance and
	  compatibility of Windows VMs.

	  If unsure, say Y.
