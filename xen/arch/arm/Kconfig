	  This option adds an alternative code sequence to work around ARM
	  erratum 827319 on Cortex-A53 parts up to r0p2 with an AMBA 5 CHI
	  master interface and an L2 cache.

	  Under certain conditions this erratum can cause a clean line eviction
	  to occur at the same time as another transaction to the same address
	  on the AMBA 5 CHI interface, which can cause data corruption if the
	  interconnect reorders the two transactions.

	  The workaround promotes data cache clean instructions to

	  This option adds an alternative code sequence to work around ARM

	  If a Cortex-A53 processor is executing a store or prefetch for

	  This option adds an alternative code sequence to work around ARM

	  present when it is connected to a coherent interconnect.

	  If the processor is executing a load and store exclusive sequence at

	  This option adds an alternative code sequence to work around ARM
	  erratum 843419 on Cortex-A53 parts up to r0p4.

	  When executing in AArch64 state, a load or store instruction which uses
	  the result of an ADRP instruction as a base register, or which uses a
	  base register written by an instruction immediately after an ADRP to the
	  same register, might access an incorrect address.

	  The workaround enables the linker to check if the affected sequence is

	  This option adds an alternative code sequence to work around ARM

	  Affected Cortex-A57 parts might deadlock when exclusive load/store
	  instructions to Write-Back memory are mixed with Device loads.

	  The workaround is to promote device loads to use Load-Acquire

	  This option adds an alternative code sequence to work around ARM
	  erratum 834220 on Cortex-A57 parts up to r1p2.

	  Affected Cortex-A57 parts might report a Stage 2 translation
	  fault as the result of a Stage 1 fault for load crossing a
	  page boundary when there is a permission or device memory
	  alignment fault at Stage 1 and a translation fault at Stage 2.

	  The workaround is to verify that the Stage 1 translation
	  doesn't generate a fault before handling the Stage 2 fault.
	  Please note that this does not necessarily enable the workaround,

	  Affected Cortex-A73 might return wrong read value for CNTVCT or CNTPCT

	  break-before-make sequence, then under very rare circumstances
	  TLBI+DSB completes before a read using the translation being

	  operations.

	help
	  This option adds a workaround for Arm Cortex-A77 erratum 1508412.

	  Affected Cortex-A77 cores (r0p0, r1p0) could deadlock on a sequence
	  of a store-exclusive or read of PAR_EL1 and a load with device or
	  non-cacheable memory attributes. The workaround depends on a firmware
	  counterpart.

	  Xen guests must also have the workaround implemented or they can
	  deadlock the system.

	  Work around the issue by inserting DMB SY barriers around PAR_EL1
	  register reads and warning Xen users. The DMB barrier is sufficient
	  to prevent a speculative PAR_EL1 read.
