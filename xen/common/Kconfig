config COMPAT
	bool
	help
	  32-bit interface support on 64-bit Xen which is used for both
	  HVM and PV guests. HVMLoader makes 32-bit hypercalls irrespective
	  of the destination runmode of the guest.

config CORE_PARKING
	bool

config GRANT_TABLE
	bool "Grant table support" if EXPERT = "y"
	default y
	---help---
	  Grant table provides a generic mechanism to memory sharing
	  between domains. This shared memory interface underpins the
	  split device drivers for block and network IO in a classic
	  Xen setup.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config HAS_ALTERNATIVE
	bool

config HAS_DEVICE_TREE
	bool

config HAS_EX_TABLE
	bool

config HAS_FAST_MULTIPLY
	bool

config MEM_ACCESS_ALWAYS_ON
	bool

config MEM_ACCESS
	def_bool MEM_ACCESS_ALWAYS_ON
	prompt "Memory Access and VM events" if !MEM_ACCESS_ALWAYS_ON
	---help---

	  Framework to configure memory access types for guests and receive
	  related events in userspace.

config HAS_MEM_PAGING
	bool

config HAS_PDX
	bool

config HAS_UBSAN
	bool

menu "Speculative hardening"

config SPECULATIVE_HARDEN_ARRAY
	bool "Speculative Array Hardening"
	default y
	---help---
	  Contemporary processors may use speculative execution as a
	  performance optimisation, but this can potentially be abused by an
	  attacker to leak data via speculative sidechannels.

	  One source of data leakage is via speculative out-of-bounds array
	  accesses.

	  When enabled, specific array accesses which have been deemed liable
	  to be speculatively abused will be hardened to avoid out-of-bounds
	  accesses.

	  This is a best-effort mitigation.  There are no guarantees that all
	  areas of code open to abuse have been hardened.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config KEXEC
	bool "kexec support"
	default y
	depends on HAS_KEXEC
	---help---
	  Allows a running Xen hypervisor to be replaced with another OS
	  without rebooting. This is primarily used to execute a crash
	  environment to collect information on a Xen hypervisor or dom0 crash.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config XENOPROF
	def_bool y
	prompt "Xen Oprofile Support" if EXPERT = "y"
	depends on X86
	---help---
	  Xen OProfile (Xenoprof) is a system-wide profiler for Xen virtual
	  machine environments, capable of profiling the Xen virtual machine
	  monitor, multiple Linux guest operating systems, and applications
	  running on them.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config XSM
	bool "Xen Security Modules support"
	default ARM
	---help---
	  Enables the security framework known as Xen Security Modules which
	  allows administrators fine-grained control over a Xen domain and
	  its capabilities by defining permissible interactions between domains,
	  the hypervisor itself, and related resources such as memory and
	  devices.

	  If unsure, say N.

config XSM_FLASK
	def_bool y
	prompt "FLux Advanced Security Kernel support"
	depends on XSM
	---help---
	  Enables FLASK (FLux Advanced Security Kernel) as the access control
	  mechanism used by the XSM framework.  This provides a mandatory access
	  control framework by which security enforcement, isolation, and
	  auditing can be achieved with fine granular control via a security
	  policy.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config XSM_FLASK_AVC_STATS
	def_bool y
	prompt "Maintain statistics on the FLASK access vector cache" if EXPERT = "y"
	depends on XSM_FLASK
	---help---
	  Maintain counters on the access vector cache that can be viewed using
	  the FLASK_AVC_CACHESTATS sub-op of the xsm_op hypercall.  Disabling
	  this will save a tiny amount of memory and time to update the stats.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config XSM_FLASK_POLICY
	bool "Compile Xen with a built-in FLASK security policy"
	default y if HAS_CHECKPOLICY = "y"
	depends on XSM_FLASK
	---help---
	  This includes a default XSM policy in the hypervisor so that the
	  bootloader does not need to load a policy to get sane behavior from an
	  XSM-enabled hypervisor.  If this is disabled, a policy must be
	  provided by the bootloader or by Domain 0.  Even if this is enabled, a
	  policy provided by the bootloader will override it.

	  This requires that the SELinux policy compiler (checkpolicy) be
	  available when compiling the hypervisor.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config XSM_SILO
	def_bool y
	prompt "SILO support"
	depends on XSM
	---help---
	  Enables SILO as the access control mechanism used by the XSM framework.
	  This is not the default module, add boot parameter xsm=silo to choose
	  it. This will deny any unmediated communication channels (grant tables
	  and event channels) between unprivileged VMs.

	  If unsure, say Y.

choice
	prompt "Default XSM implementation"
	depends on XSM
	default XSM_SILO_DEFAULT if XSM_SILO && ARM
	default XSM_FLASK_DEFAULT if XSM_FLASK
	default XSM_SILO_DEFAULT if XSM_SILO
	default XSM_DUMMY_DEFAULT
	config XSM_DUMMY_DEFAULT
		bool "Match non-XSM behavior"
	config XSM_FLASK_DEFAULT
		bool "FLux Advanced Security Kernel" if XSM_FLASK
	config XSM_SILO_DEFAULT
		bool "SILO" if XSM_SILO
endchoice

config LATE_HWDOM
	bool "Dedicated hardware domain"
	default n
	depends on XSM && X86
	---help---
	  Allows the creation of a dedicated hardware domain distinct from
	  domain 0 that manages devices without needing access to other
	  privileged functionality such as the ability to manage domains.
	  This requires that the actual domain 0 be a stub domain that
	  constructs the actual hardware domain instead of initializing the
	  hardware itself.  Because the hardware domain needs access to
	  hypercalls not available to unprivileged guests, an XSM policy
	  is required to properly define the privilege of these domains.

	  This feature does nothing if the "hardware_dom" boot parameter is
	  not present.  If this feature is being used for security, it should
	  be combined with an IOMMU in strict mode.

	  If unsure, say N.

config ARGO
	bool "Argo: hypervisor-mediated interdomain communication" if EXPERT = "y"
	---help---
	  Enables a hypercall for domains to ask the hypervisor to perform
	  data transfer of messages between domains.

	  This allows communication channels to be established that do not
	  require any shared memory between domains; the hypervisor is the
	  entity that each domain interacts with. The hypervisor is able to
	  enforce Mandatory Access Control policy over the communication.

	  If XSM_FLASK is enabled, XSM policy can govern which domains may
	  communicate via the Argo system.

	  This feature does nothing if the "argo" boot parameter is not present.
	  Argo is disabled at runtime by default.

	  If unsure, say N.

menu "Schedulers"
	visible if EXPERT = "y"

config SCHED_CREDIT
	bool "Credit scheduler support"
	default y
	---help---
	  The traditional credit scheduler is a general purpose scheduler.

config SCHED_CREDIT2
	bool "Credit2 scheduler support"
	default y
	---help---
	  The credit2 scheduler is a general purpose scheduler that is
	  optimized for lower latency and higher VM density.

config SCHED_RTDS
	bool "RTDS scheduler support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	default y
	---help---
	  The RTDS scheduler is a soft and firm real-time scheduler for
	  multicore, targeted for embedded, automotive, graphics and gaming
	  in the cloud, and general low-latency workloads.

config SCHED_ARINC653
	bool "ARINC653 scheduler support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	default DEBUG
	---help---
	  The ARINC653 scheduler is a hard real-time scheduler for single
	  cores, targeted for avionics, drones, and medical devices.

config SCHED_NULL
	bool "Null scheduler support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	default y
	---help---
	  The null scheduler is a static, zero overhead scheduler,
	  for when there always are less vCPUs than pCPUs, typically
	  in embedded or HPC scenarios.

choice
	prompt "Default Scheduler?"
	default SCHED_CREDIT2_DEFAULT

	config SCHED_CREDIT_DEFAULT
		bool "Credit Scheduler" if SCHED_CREDIT
	config SCHED_CREDIT2_DEFAULT
		bool "Credit2 Scheduler" if SCHED_CREDIT2
	config SCHED_RTDS_DEFAULT
		bool "RT Scheduler" if SCHED_RTDS
	config SCHED_ARINC653_DEFAULT
		bool "ARINC653 Scheduler" if SCHED_ARINC653

endmenu

config CRYPTO
	bool

config LIVEPATCH
	bool "Live patching support"
	default X86
	depends on HAS_BUILD_ID = "y"
	---help---
	  Allows a running Xen hypervisor to be dynamically patched using
	  binary patches without rebooting. This is primarily used to binarily
	  patch in the field an hypervisor with XSA fixes.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config FAST_SYMBOL_LOOKUP
	bool "Fast symbol lookup (bigger binary)"
	default y
	depends on LIVEPATCH
	---help---
	  When searching for symbol addresses we can use the built-in system
	  that is optimized for searching symbols using addresses as the key.
	  However using it for the inverse (find address using the symbol name)
	  it is slow. This extra data and code (~55kB) speeds up the search.
	  The only user of this is Live patching.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config SUPPRESS_DUPLICATE_SYMBOL_WARNINGS
	bool "Suppress duplicate symbol warnings" if !LIVEPATCH
	default y if !LIVEPATCH
	---help---
	  Multiple symbols with the same name aren't generally a problem
	  unless Live patching is to be used, so these warnings can be
	  suppressed by enabling this option.  Certain other options (known
	  to produce many duplicate names) may select this to avoid the
	  build becoming overly verbose.

config CMDLINE
	string "Built-in hypervisor command string" if EXPERT = "y"
	default ""
	---help---
	  Enter arguments here that should be compiled into the hypervisor
	  image and used at boot time. When the system boots, this string
	  will be parsed prior to the bootloader command line. So if a
	  non-cumulative option is set both in this string and in the
	  bootloader command line, only the latter one will take effect.

config CMDLINE_OVERRIDE
	bool "Built-in command line overrides bootloader arguments"
	default n
	depends on CMDLINE != ""
	---help---
	  Set this option to 'Y' to have the hypervisor ignore the bootloader
	  command line, and use ONLY the built-in command line.

	  This is used to work around broken bootloaders. This should
	  be set to 'N' under normal conditions.

config DOM0_MEM
	string "Default value for dom0_mem boot parameter"
	default ""
	---help---
	  Sets a default value for dom0_mem, e.g. "512M".
	  The specified string will be used for the dom0_mem parameter in
	  case it was not specified on the command line.

	  See docs/misc/xen-command-line.markdown for the supported syntax.

	  Leave empty if you are not sure what to specify.

config TRACEBUFFER
	bool "Enable tracing infrastructure" if EXPERT = "y"
	default y
	---help---
	  Enable tracing infrastructure and pre-defined tracepoints within Xen.
	  This will allow live information about Xen's execution and performance
	  to be collected at run time for debugging or performance analysis.
	  Memory and execution overhead when not active is minimal.
