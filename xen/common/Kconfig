config COMPAT
	bool
	help
	  32-bit interface support on 64-bit Xen which is used for both
	  HVM and PV guests. HVMLoader makes 32-bit hypercalls irrespective
	  of the destination runmode of the guest.

config HAS_BUILD_ID

config HAS_CHECKPOLICY
	string
	option env="XEN_HAS_CHECKPOLICY"

config KEXEC
	bool "kexec support"
	default y
	depends on HAS_KEXEC
	---help---
	  Allows a running Xen hypervisor to be replaced with another OS
	  without rebooting. This is primarily used to execute a crash
	  environment to collect information on a Xen hypervisor or dom0 crash.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config TMEM
	def_bool y
	prompt "Transcendent Memory Support" if EXPERT = "y"
	---help---
	  Transcendent memory allows PV-aware guests to collaborate on memory
	  usage. Guests can 'swap' their memory to the hypervisor or have an
	  collective pool of memory shared across guests. The end result is
	  less memory usage by guests allowing higher guest density.

	  You also have to enable it on the Xen commandline by using tmem=1

	  If unsure, say Y.

config XENOPROF
	def_bool y
	prompt "Xen Oprofile Support" if EXPERT = "y"
	depends on X86
	---help---
	  Xen OProfile (Xenoprof) is a system-wide profiler for Xen virtual
	  machine environments, capable of profiling the Xen virtual machine
	  monitor, multiple Linux guest operating systems, and applications
	  running on them.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config XSM
	bool "Xen Security Modules support"
	default n
	---help---
	  Enables the security framework known as Xen Security Modules which
	  allows administrators fine-grained control over a Xen domain and
	  its capabilities by defining permissible interactions between domains,
	  the hypervisor itself, and related resources such as memory and
	  devices.

	  If unsure, say N.

config FLASK
	def_bool y
	prompt "FLux Advanced Security Kernel support" if EXPERT = "y"
	depends on XSM
	---help---
	  Enables FLASK (FLux Advanced Security Kernel) as the access control
	  mechanism used by the XSM framework.  This provides a mandatory access
	  control framework by which security enforcement, isolation, and
	  auditing can be achieved with fine granular control via a security
	  policy.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config FLASK_AVC_STATS
	def_bool y
	prompt "Maintain statistics on the FLASK access vector cache" if EXPERT = "y"
	depends on FLASK
	---help---
	  Maintain counters on the access vector cache that can be viewed using
	  the FLASK_AVC_CACHESTATS sub-op of the xsm_op hypercall.  Disabling
	  this will save a tiny amount of memory and time to update the stats.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config XSM_POLICY
	bool "Compile Xen with a built-in security policy"
	default y if HAS_CHECKPOLICY = "y"
	depends on XSM
	---help---
	  This includes a default XSM policy in the hypervisor so that the
	  bootloader does not need to load a policy to get sane behavior from an
	  XSM-enabled hypervisor.  If this is disabled, a policy must be
	  provided by the bootloader or by Domain 0.  Even if this is enabled, a
	  policy provided by the bootloader will override it.

	  This requires that the SELinux policy compiler (checkpolicy) be
	  available when compiling the hypervisor.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config LATE_HWDOM
	bool "Dedicated hardware domain"
	default n
	depends on XSM && X86
	---help---
	  Allows the creation of a dedicated hardware domain distinct from
	  domain 0 that manages devices without needing access to other
	  privileged functionality such as the ability to manage domains.
	  This requires that the actual domain 0 be a stub domain that
	  constructs the actual hardware domain instead of initializing the
	  hardware itself.  Because the hardware domain needs access to
	  hypercalls not available to unprivileged guests, an XSM policy
	  is required to properly define the privilege of these domains.

	  This feature does nothing if the "hardware_dom" boot parameter is
	  not present.  If this feature is being used for security, it should
	  be combined with an IOMMU in strict mode.

	  If unsure, say N.

menu "Schedulers"
	visible if EXPERT = "y"

config SCHED_CREDIT
	def_bool y
	---help---
	  The traditional credit scheduler is a general purpose scheduler.

config SCHED_CREDIT2
	bool "Credit2 scheduler support"
	default y
	---help---
	  The credit2 scheduler is a general purpose scheduler that is
	  optimized for lower latency and higher VM density.

config SCHED_RTDS
	bool "RTDS scheduler support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	default y
	---help---
	  The RTDS scheduler is a soft and firm real-time scheduler for
	  multicore, targeted for embedded, automotive, graphics and gaming
	  in the cloud, and general low-latency workloads.

config SCHED_ARINC653
	bool "ARINC653 scheduler support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	default y
	---help---
	  The ARINC653 scheduler is a hard real-time scheduler for single
	  cores, targeted for avionics, drones, and medical devices.

config SCHED_NULL
	bool "Null scheduler support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	default y
	---help---
	  The null scheduler is a static, zero overhead scheduler,
	  for when there always are less vCPUs than pCPUs, typically
	  in embedded or HPC scenarios.

	prompt "Default Scheduler?"
	default SCHED_CREDIT_DEFAULT

endmenu

config CRYPTO
	bool

config LIVEPATCH
	bool "Live patching support"
	default X86
	depends on HAS_BUILD_ID = "y"
	---help---
	  Allows a running Xen hypervisor to be dynamically patched using
	  binary patches without rebooting. This is primarily used to binarily
	  patch in the field an hypervisor with XSA fixes.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config FAST_SYMBOL_LOOKUP
	bool "Fast symbol lookup (bigger binary)"
	default y
	depends on LIVEPATCH
	---help---
	  When searching for symbol addresses we can use the built-in system
	  that is optimized for searching symbols using addresses as the key.
	  However using it for the inverse (find address using the symbol name)
	  it is slow. This extra data and code (~55kB) speeds up the search.
	  The only user of this is Live patching.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config SUPPRESS_DUPLICATE_SYMBOL_WARNINGS
	bool "Suppress duplicate symbol warnings" if !LIVEPATCH
	default y if !LIVEPATCH
	---help---
	  Multiple symbols with the same name aren't generally a problem
	  unless Live patching is to be used, so these warnings can be
	  suppressed by enabling this option.  Certain other options (known
	  to produce many duplicate names) may select this to avoid the
	  build becoming overly verbose.

config CMDLINE
	string "Built-in hypervisor command string" if EXPERT = "y"
	default ""
	---help---
	  Enter arguments here that should be compiled into the hypervisor
	  image and used at boot time. When the system boots, this string
	  will be parsed prior to the bootloader command line. So if a
	  non-cumulative option is set both in this string and in the
	  bootloader command line, only the latter one will take effect.

config CMDLINE_OVERRIDE
	bool "Built-in command line overrides bootloader arguments"
	default n
	depends on CMDLINE != ""
	---help---
	  Set this option to 'Y' to have the hypervisor ignore the bootloader
	  command line, and use ONLY the built-in command line.

	  This is used to work around broken bootloaders. This should
	  be set to 'N' under normal conditions.
