config DEBUG
	bool "Developer Checks"
	default y
	---help---
	  If you say Y here this will enable developer checks such as asserts
	  and extra printks. This option is intended for development purposes
	  only, and not for production use.

	  You probably want to say 'N' here.

if DEBUG || EXPERT = "y"

config CRASH_DEBUG
	bool "Crash Debugging Support"
	depends on X86
	---help---
	  If you want to attach gdb to Xen to debug Xen if it crashes
	  then say Y.

config FRAME_POINTER
	bool "Compile Xen with frame pointers"
	default DEBUG
	---help---
	  If you say Y here the resulting Xen will be slightly larger and
	  maybe slower, but it gives very useful debugging information
	  in case of any Xen bugs.

config GCOV
	bool "Gcov Support"
	depends on !LIVEPATCH
	select SUPPRESS_DUPLICATE_SYMBOL_WARNINGS
	---help---
	  Enable gcov (a test coverage program in GCC) support.

	  If unsure, say N here.

config LOCK_PROFILE
	bool "Lock Profiling"
	---help---
	  Lock profiling allows you to see how often locks are taken and blocked.
	  You can use serial console to print (and reset) using 'l' and 'L'
	  respectively, or the 'xenlockprof' tool.

config PERF_COUNTERS
	bool "Performance Counters"
	---help---
	  Enables software performance counters that allows you to analyze
	  bottlenecks in the system.  To access this data you can use serial
	  console to print (and reset) using 'p' and 'P' respectively, or
	  the 'xenperf' tool.

config PERF_ARRAYS
	bool "Performance Counter Array Histograms"
	depends on PERF_COUNTERS
	---help---
	  Enables software performance counter array histograms.


config VERBOSE_DEBUG
	bool "Verbose debug messages"
	default DEBUG
	---help---
	  Guest output from HYPERVISOR_console_io and hypervisor parsing
	  ELF images (dom0) will be logged in the Xen ring buffer.

config DEVICE_TREE_DEBUG
	bool "Device tree debug messages"
	depends on HAS_DEVICE_TREE
	---help---
	  Device tree parsing and DOM0 device tree building messages are
	  logged in the Xen ring buffer.
	  If unsure, say N here.

config SCRUB_DEBUG
	bool "Page scrubbing test"
	default DEBUG
	---help---
	  Verify that pages that need to be scrubbed before being allocated to
	  a guest are indeed scrubbed.

config UBSAN
	bool "Undefined behaviour sanitizer"
	depends on HAS_UBSAN
	---help---
	  Enable undefined behaviour sanitizer. It uses compiler to insert code
	  snippets so that undefined behaviours in C are detected during runtime.
	  This requires a UBSAN capable compiler and it is a debug only feature.

	  If unsure, say N here.
